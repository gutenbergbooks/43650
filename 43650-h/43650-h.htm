<h2>Preface</h2>


<p>The position of Johann Sebastian Bach as one of a
numerous family of musicians is unique. Of no other
composer can it be said that his forefathers, contemporary
relations, and descendants were all musicians, and not
only musicians, but holders of very important offices as
such. All his biographers have therefore given some
account of his family antecedents before proceeding to
the history of his life; and I have found myself obliged
to follow the same course. In other respects I have
adopted the plan made use of by the older biographers,
of keeping the account of his life distinct from that of
his compositions.</p>

<p>Every biography is necessarily based on that written
by his two sons, four years after his death, published by
Mizler, and the one published in 1802 by Forkel, who
was intimate with the sons. Hilgenfeldt’s account follows
these, and in later years further information has been
acquired from the searches into archives, and other
ancient documents, by C. H. Bitter and Philipp Spitta.
Any details concerning the life and works of this remarkable
man are interesting; and it is probable that
researches will be continued for some time to come.
Thus, last year (1898) a “celebration” took place at
Ohrdruf in memory of Bach’s school career there; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_a006" id="Page_a006">[vi]</a></span>
Dr Friedrich Thomas took the opportunity of publishing
some details of the Bach family which had escaped Spitta.</p>

<p>The name of Bach is reverenced by Thuringian organists,
and I this year had interesting conversations with his
successors at Arnstadt and Mühlhausen, Herr Kellermann
and Herr Möller. But the chief music-seller at Arnstadt
told me that “Bach’s music is out of date; no one
has now any interest in such old-fashioned compositions.”</p>

<p>The two recent important accounts of Bach’s life are
those of C. H. Bitter, 1865, 2 vols.; second edition
1880, 4 vols.; and Philipp Spitta, 2 vols, a translation
of which by Mrs Clara Bell and Mr Fuller-Maitland was
published by Messrs Novello in 1884. With regard to
the last, I have to thank Messrs Novello for kindly
allowing me the use of the book at a time when it was
out of print. I understand that a second edition has
since been published.</p>

<p>References to Spitta apply to the first edition of the
translation; all others to the original German.</p>

<p>John Sebastian Bach came of a large family of Thuringian
musicians, whose members have been traced back to
the first decade of the sixteenth century. The name
frequently occurs in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
among the inhabitants of Arnstadt, Erfurt, Gräfenrode,
Molsdorf, Rockhausen and other villages; and that
it has not yet disappeared is shown by the fact that the
Erfurt Directory for 1899 contains the addresses of no
less than thirteen Bachs.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Founder of
the Family</i></div>

<p>The subject of this biography considered that the
founder of his family was Veit Bach, who had settled
at Presburg in Hungary as a baker and
miller. Owing to religious persecution, however,
he sold what he could of his property,
returned to Thuringia with the proceeds, and
settled at the village of Wechmar near Gotha. Here
he recommenced his trade, and occupied his leisure with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the cithara, or cither, even taking it to the mill, where he
played it to the rhythmical tapping of the wheels. “He
must,” says John Sebastian, “at any rate have learned
time in this way.” The date of his birth is unknown.
He died 1619 and left two sons, Hans and Johannes.
All his descendants, to the number of sixty, were, with
only two or three exceptions, musicians. Hans Bach,
the great-grandfather of John Sebastian, was a weaver
by trade as well as a musician. His father, Veit,
sent him to Gotha to study music under a relative,
Caspar Bach, the “town piper.” In his capacity of
“Spielmann” or “Player” Hans travelled about to
different towns in Thuringia to take part in the “town
music” with his violin, and as he was also very
humorous he became popular, and twice had his portrait
painted. He died of the plague in 1626. He
seems to have left several children, of whom three
were musicians&mdash;</p>

<p>The following genealogy will enable the reader to distinguish
the various members of this remarkable family.
The names of sons only are given, as the daughters do
not appear to have distinguished themselves. The list of
nearly sixty names is not, however, by any means exhaustive.
Spitta gives many more, and there were of course a great
number whose names are entirely lost, for a peasant and
artisan family is not usually careful to keep its genealogical
tables in order.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Music and War</div>

<p>Johann (No. 4) was born at Wechmar. He was
apprenticed to the town piper of Suhl and became organist
at Schweinfurt. In 1635 he married the daughter of his
former master, and became director of the town musicians
at Erfurt. During the time he was there the city was
suffering terribly from the effects of pillage and quartering
of soldiers, poverty and disorder; yet Johann Bach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
managed to found a family which multiplied rapidly, and
soon filled all the town musicians’ places, so that for some
century and a half, and long after no more of the family
lived in the place, the town musicians were known as
“The Bachs.”</p>

<p>He married twice, his second wife being Hedwig
Lämmerhirt.</p>

<p>He was organist of the Prediger Kirche at Erfurt, and
was called by his contemporaries an “illustrious musician,”
and he in a kind of way forestalled John Sebastian in
being skilful in both sacred and secular, vocal and
instrumental music.</p>

<p>The three towns of Erfurt, Arnstadt and Eisenach, now
became the chief centres of the Bach family.</p>

<p>Christoph Bach (No. 5), the grandfather of Sebastian,
born at Wechmar, entered the service of the Grand Duke
of Weimar as lackey and musician. In 1642 he was a
member of the Guild of Musicians at Erfurt, and in 1654
was Court and Town musician at Arnstadt, where his
younger brother Heinrich was living. He does not seem
ever to have been an organist, but a “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kunstpfeifer</span>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Thirty
Years’ War</i></div>

<p>During the Thirty Years’ War the town pipers and
musicians had sunk very low in public estimation, and
about the middle of the seventeenth century
a strong effort was made by their various
guilds to raise themselves to a more dignified
position, in keeping with the worthiness of their calling.
To this end they combined in drawing up a code of
statutes, which was ratified by the Emperor Ferdinand
III.;<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> the Bach family seem, however, to have kept
aloof from this combination, and there is no doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
they were better educated than the majority of town
musicians.</p>

<p>Heinrich (No. 6) was appointed organist of the Franciscan
Church at Arnstadt in 1641, which office he filled
for fifty years. He suffered severely from the war, which
disorganised everything, and his salary, like that of every
one else, got into arrears. Moreover there were war taxes
to be paid, and the soldiery seem to have robbed and
plundered at their will. He petitioned the Count of
Schwarzburg for his salary as he “knew not where to
find bread for himself and his young family.” The
Count ordered his salary to be paid, but the keeper
of the funds immediately resigned. It is supposed that
Bach managed to eke out his existence by cultivating a
small plot of land which it was usual to give to organists
in Thuringia as part of their salary. He kept to his
pious and simple life all through the horrors of the times,
(which reduced the mass of the people to a state of coarseness
and immorality), and brought up six children, three
of whom became famous musicians in their day. In the
funeral sermon preached by Olearius, he is mentioned as
the composer of chorales, motets, concertos, fugues and
preludes, but few of his compositions have been preserved.</p>

<p>Johann Christian Bach (No. 7), a viola player and
music director, belonged to Erfurt, whence he went to
Eisenach, being the first of his family to settle there.</p>

<p>Johann Ægidius Bach (No. 8) became director of the
town musicians and alto-viola player at Erfurt in succession
to his brother Joh. Christian (No. 7) and his cousin
Ambrosius (No. 11) when they moved to Eisenach.
Like several others of his clan he married the sister of his
elder brother’s wife, and soon after became organist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
St Michael’s Church, which post he held to an advanced
age.</p>

<p>John Nicolaus Bach (No. 9) was a town musician and
good performer on the viola-da-gamba. He died of the
plague in 1682.</p>

<p>Georg Christoph Bach (No. 10), born at Erfurt, was an
usher in a school at Heinrichs near Suhl, but became
cantor, first at Themar, near Meiningen, and afterwards
at Schweinfurt, where he died. He was a composer, but
his works are all lost.</p>

<div class="sidenote">J. Ambrosius Bach</div>

<p>Johann Ambrosius Bach (No. 11), the father of John
Sebastian, was twin brother to Johann Christoph (No. 12).
The two brothers had a most remarkable likeness, not
only externally but in character and temperament. They
were both violinists and played in exactly the same style;
they thought and spoke alike, and their appearance was so
similar that it is said their own wives could not distinguish
them apart. They suffered from the same illnesses, and
died within a few months of one another.</p>

<p>Ambrosius first settled at Erfurt as an alto-viola<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
player, and was elected a member of the Town Council.
Here he married Elizabeth Lämmerhirt, the daughter of
a furrier, and a relation of Hedwig the wife of Johann
(No. 4). He now moved to Eisenach, and was succeeded
at Erfurt by his cousin Ægidius (No. 8). He
undertook the care of an idiot sister who died shortly
afterwards, and for whom a funeral sermon was preached,
in which the Bach brothers are referred to as being “gifted
with good understanding, with art and skill, which make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
them respected and listened to in the churches, schools,
and all the township, so that through them the Master’s
work is praised.” Little is known of the life of Ambrosius
beyond the fact that he is mentioned in the church
register at Dornheim as “the celebrated town organist
and musician of Eisenach.” Six children were born, the
youngest being Johann Sebastian.</p>

<p>Johann Christoph Bach (No. 12) was Court musician
to Count Ludwig Günther at Arnstadt. The first thing
we hear of him relates to a kind of action for breach of
promise of marriage brought before the Consistory at
Arnstadt by Anna Cunigunda Wiener, with whom he
had “kept company” and exchanged rings. The Consistory
(a spiritual court) decided that Bach must marry
her, but, with the independence of character which was
peculiar to his family, he refused and defied them&mdash;an
unheard-of thing for a musician to do in those days&mdash;declaring
that he “hated the Wienerin so that he
could not bear the sight of her.”<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> The case lingered
for two and a half years, and ended in his favour. He
remained single for many years afterwards, marrying
eventually a daughter of the churchwarden of Ohrdruf.</p>

<p>Quarrels between Gräser, the town musician, and Johann
Christoph Bach led to the dismissal of all the Court
musicians on account of the disunion which made it impossible
for music to prosper. For a time, therefore, he
had to make a meagre living by “piping before the
doors,” but after the death of the Count his successor
reappointed Bach “Court musician and town piper.” At
this time Adam Drese was Capellmeister at Arnstadt, and
there exist catalogues of the Court musicians which are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of interest as showing the kind of musical establishment
that prevailed at the petty courts in Germany. One of
these catalogues gives the names of seven singers, four
violinists, three viola players, a contrabassist, and the
organist Heinrich Bach (No. 6).</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
orchestra
at
Arnstadt</i></div>

<p>There were trumpeters, and extra singers from the
school, who could also play stringed instruments, so that
on occasion a very respectable string orchestra
was available, consisting of twelve violins, three
alto violas, three tenor violas, two bass viols,
and a contrabasso. The violoncello does not
seem to have been represented. Christoph
Bach’s income in later life was sufficient not only to raise
him above want, but to enable him to leave something to
his family, on his death, in 1694, at the age of forty-eight.</p>


<div class="sidenote">J. Christoph Bach</div>

<div>Johann Christoph Bach (No. 13) was born at Arnstadt,
and studied under his father Heinrich (No. 6).
He was appointed organist at Eisenach in 1665, which
post he held till his death sixty years later. He and his
brother Michael (No. 14) were born during the worst
time of the disturbance produced by the war, yet such was
the vigour of their race that, uninfluenced by the general
degeneracy and misery, they both became celebrated
composers, Michael leaning towards instrumental, and
Christoph to vocal music. <div class="sidenote"><i>A Church
Cantata</i></div>
An important church work,
describing the strife between Michael and
the Devil, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es erhob sich ein Streit</span>,” is
fully described with musical quotations by
Spitta (vol. i. p. 45, &amp;c.). For its performance it
required two five part choirs, two violins, four violas,
one bassoon, four trumpets, drums, double bass, and
organ. The cantata is preceded by a “sonata” for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
instruments, without trumpets and drums, something
in the form of the French overture. The work itself
is modelled on those of Hammerschmidt, who, with
Schütz, created a form which culminated in the Handel
oratorio. Spitta says that it shows “power of invention
and genius,” and that “it was impossible that so important
a composition should fail to make an impression
on many sincere artistic natures, in spite of the small
amount of intelligent sympathy which was shown for
Johann Christoph Bach, alike by his contemporaries and
by posterity.” Sebastian Bach thought very highly of his
uncle’s work, and performed it at Leipsic.</div>

<p>Johann Christoph composed many chorale-vorspiele for
the organ, of which forty-eight are preserved in a MS.
formerly belonging to Spitta. The themes are worked
out on the same lines as those of John Sebastian, but in
a more elementary form. His vocal compositions are,
however, much in advance of his instrumental works, and
he seems certainly to have been the most important
member of his family before his great nephew appeared.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An
organist’s
income</i></div>

<p>Johann Michael Bach (No. 14) was an accomplished
organist. His character may be imagined from the
account of his appointment to the organistship of Gehren
near Arnstadt, when we are told that after his examination,
the authorities thanked the Count for having sent
them a peaceable, retiring, and skillful performer.
He was also made parish clerk, and
his income from the two posts amounted
to 74 gülden, 18 cords of wood, 5 measures
of corn, 9 measures of barley, 3&frac12; barrels of beer,
some land, and a house free of rent. Besides being
a composer he made clavichords and violins. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
youngest daughter became Sebastian Bach’s first wife. A
cantata on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach! bleib bei uns, Herr Jesu Christ</span>” by
him is preserved in the Bach archives in the Royal
Library at Berlin, “full of interesting details and ingenious
ideas.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> It is scored for four voices, two violins,
three violas, bassoon, and organ, and is preceded by a
“sonata.” Twelve of his motets are preserved, but they
are incoherent in structure, being composed in a time of
transition. Some of them are to be accompanied by
strings which double the various voice parts, and ten of
them are interwoven with chorales. In “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Das Blut Jesu
Christi</span>” for five voices “the deep feeling of the compositions
overcomes us with irresistible power, and one
forgets the imperfection of the body in the beauty of the
soul which shines through.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Four of the motets are for
double chorus and in some one can feel “the romantic
spirit of Sebastian Bach.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Bachs</div>

<p>Johann Günther Bach (No. 15) was a good organist,
and deputised for his father when absent from Arnstadt.
Little is known of his life, but Hilgenfeldt says he is mentioned
as a capable instrument maker as well as organist.</p>

<p>Johann Jacob Bach (No. 16) did not follow the musical
profession.</p>

<p>Johann Christoph Bach (No. 17), also born at Erfurt,
was cantor and organist of Unterzimmern near Erfurt.
In 1698 he succeeded Michael Bach in the Cantorship
at Gehren. He was threatened with removal by the
Arnstadt authorities on account of his temper, though
the threat was never carried out. He died in 1727.</p>

<p>Johann Bernhard Bach (No. 18), born at Erfurt, was
at first organist in his native town, then at Magdeburg<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
and afterwards succeeded Johann Christoph (No. 13) in
1703, as Court and town organist at Eisenach, and was
also made Chamber Musician to the Duke of Sax-Eisenach.
Of his compositions there remain four suites for orchestra,
some small pieces for cembalo and some chorale arrangements.
According to Spitta he was one of the most able
composers of his time, following the lines of Pachelbel.
His orchestral works were so esteemed by John Sebastian
that he copied them, and the copies still exist.</p>

<p>Johann Christoph Bach (No. 19) was “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Raths-Musikdirector</span>”
(Town Council Musical-director) at Erfurt, in
succession to Ægidius.</p>

<p>Johann Nicolaus Bach (No. 20), a surgeon, settled in
East Prussia, where he brought up a numerous family.</p>

<p>Johann Valentin Bach (No. 21) was town musician
and head watchman at Schweinfurt.</p>

<p>Of Johann Christian Bach (No. 22), and Johann Georg
(No. 23), nothing is known.</p>

<p>Johann Christoph Bach (No. 24), the elder brother of
Sebastian, organist and schoolmaster at Ohrdruf, was a
pupil of Pachelbel, and appears to have made some
reputation as a musician, since he refused an invitation
to go to Gotha as organist, on account of an increase of
salary being given him at Ohrdruf.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

He went to Sweden, and all traces of him were lost.</p>

<p>Johann Ludwig Bach (No. 33) held the post of capellmeister

<p>We now come to the sons of Johann Sebastian. An
account of their services to art will be found in C. H.
Bitter’s “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Die Söhne Sebastian Bachs</span>,” published by
Breitkopf and Härtel, 1883. We must be here content
with a bare outline of their biographies.</p>

<p>Wilhelm Friedemann Bach (No. 49), born at Weimar,
was a pupil of his father and of Graun, concert-meister of
Merseburg. He went to the University of Leipsic, where
he distinguished himself in law and mathematics. In
1732 he became organist of St Sophia at Dresden, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
giving this up, he accompanied his father on his various
journeys. In 1747 he became music-director of a church
in Halle, and is sometimes called the “Halle Bach.”
Quitting this post he lived without employment at various
places, and died at Berlin in 1784 in great poverty and
misery, having been given to drink.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>W. F. Bach
as an
organist</i></div>

<p>Fétis and Bitter say he was the greatest organist in
Germany after his father, and Forkel states that his
“clavier-playing was light, brilliant, and
charming,” and his “organ style was elevated,
solemn, and full of religious feeling.”
He extemporised much but composed little,
though some sonatas for clavecin, both solo and with
violin, some polonaises, organ-pieces, concertos, fugues,
symphonies and cantatas have come down to us.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Berlin
Bach</i></div>

<p>Carl Philipp Emanuel (No. 51) the most celebrated
of Sebastian’s sons is called the “Berlin Bach,” having
lived in that city for twenty-nine years. He
studied at St Thomas’ School at Leipsic
under his father, and afterwards joined the
University of Leipsic as a student of law, but completed
this course of study at Frankfort on the Oder. In
1738 he entered the service of Frederick the Great
at Berlin as cembalist. In 1767 he went to Hamburg
in succession to Telemann as director of music,
after having with great difficulty obtained leave from
the Court at Berlin to depart. Here he remained
till his death in 1788. He was a prolific composer
in all styles. A catalogue of his works is given
by Fétis, among the most important of which are
those for clavier, and his “Attempt to explain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
true art of Clavier-playing,” the first treatise on the
subject if we except Couperin’s “L’art de toucher le
clavecin.” It describes the method of John Sebastian,
from which the present style of piano-playing is developed,
and the rules for the execution of the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Manieren</span>”;
while in the second part, thorough bass and accompaniment
of voices are treated of. He became the greatest
theorist of his time, and in his autobiography he
says, “In composition and clavier-playing I have never
had any teacher but my father.” Hilgenfeldt remarks
that he was intended for a learned profession and only
studied music as an amateur; but Bitter shows that he
was an artist, and was brought up as a practical musician,
his scientific studies being secondary to music.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Emanuel’s
position in
musical
history</i></div>

<p>Emanuel occupies a very important position in the
history of music. His period was one of transition.
Polyphony had reached its highest point.
Oratorio had been developed to its greatest
splendour, and organ and clavier-playing had
reached their highest development on the
old lines. His services to art were that he
opened new paths in clavier-music, which made possible the
creations of Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven. Bitter considers
him the father of that particular kind of form which
has been found suitable to the modern piano: viz. the
sonata form. His smaller sonata forms were based on
those of the preludes in the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i> which
are in two sections, and this form was developed by
Haydn and his successors. The form is found in the six
sonatas of 1742, but it had been used by Krebs in his
“Preambles” two years earlier.</p>

<p>Johann Gottfried Bernhard Bach (No. 52) was given<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
the post of organist at Mühlhausen in response to an
earnest letter from his father to the authorities. He,
however, shortly afterwards went to Jena to study law,
and died there in 1739 of a fever.</p>

<p>Leopold August (No. 53) died young.</p>

<p>Gottfried Heinrich Bach (No. 54) is only known as
having lived in Leipsic in the year 1754.</p>

<p>Christian Gottlieb Bach (No. 55) lived only three years.</p>

<p>Ernst Andreas Bach (No. 56) died the year he was
born.</p>

<p>Johann Christoph Friedrich (No. 57), was called the
“Bückeburger Bach” from his holding a post as Chamber
musician to Count von Lippe at Bückeburg. He composed
oratorios, Passion music, and many other things.
He was remarkable for a deep insight into the essence
of harmony, and a very good style of clavier-playing,
which approached that of his brother Emanuel. He
is also mentioned as a man of amiable and upright
character.</p>

<p>Johann August Abraham Bach (No. 58) died young.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The English

<div class="sidenote">J. Christian Bach</div>

<p>Johann Christian (No. 59), called the “Milanese” and
afterwards the “English” Bach, was born at Leipsic, and
at the age of fourteen (on the death of
his father), he went to his brother Emanuel
at Berlin. When his education was completed
he went to Milan, where he worked hard at
the composition of songs. His wealth of melody, and
the facility with which he produced it, led him to attach
himself to the Neapolitan school of composition, the
result being shown in a number of works which the
greatest singers of his day took as their favourite concert
songs. His clavier works were chiefly written for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
amateur lady pupils, and it has been said that the great
increase of clavier dilettanti towards the end of the
eighteenth century is to be attributed directly to the
influence of Christian Bach.</p>

<p>He composed concertos, operas, oratorios, besides
every kind of clavier and other instrumental music in
the fashion of the day; “but,” says Schubart, “in the
midst of his frivolity the gigantic spirit of his father
always shines.” He was organist of Milan Cathedral,
and from there went to London, where he remained till
his death in 1782. Although he made a large income
from his pupils and compositions, he died deeply in
debt, and his widow (an Italian prima donna) received
a pension from the Queen.</p>

<p>The eight daughters of Sebastian showed none of the
musical talent of their brothers, and, with the exception
of three, they all died young. One of them married
Bach’s pupil Altnikol, of whom we shall hear later. The
family gradually died out, and after the sons of Sebastian,
none showed exceptional musical ability.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Family
meetings</i></div>

<p>The clan feeling was very strong. It was a family
custom to meet together at Erfurt, Eisenach or Arnstadt
once a year, and to spend a day in friendly
intercourse. The day was begun with the
singing of a chorale, after which jokes and
all manner of pleasant pastimes were indulged in.
One of their favourite pursuits on these occasions
was the singing of “quodlibets” consisting of the
endeavour to make three or four popular or well-known
songs harmonise together, these extempore
efforts being intended more as a joke than as serious
music.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
attitude towards
Art</i></div>

<p>The life and character of John Sebastian Bach have a
peculiar interest, not only for musicians and amateurs of
music, but for every one who can appreciate sterling
worth, combined with genius of the highest rank, and a
modesty as great as it is rare. “Anyone,”
said Bach, “could do as much as I have
done if he worked as hard.” And this
capacity for hard work is perhaps not the
least among the many remarkable characteristics of
the man. We find in him little of that desire for
applause, for recognition, which is usually one of the
strongest motives in an artist. He was content to labour
as few men have laboured, in a remote corner of Germany,
simply for art, and art alone. His greatest works never
saw the light of publication during his life-time: he
seemed to compose just because he obeyed the inward
spirit of genius which drove him onward, and though his
chamber works became fairly well known, his larger compositions
were rarely performed outside the church or
place for which they were composed. “The sole object<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of all music,” said he, “should be the glory of God and
pleasant recreation,” and the “glory of God” was the
mainspring of every action of his simple and pious life.</p>

<div class="caption"><div>The House at Eisenach in which J. S. Bach was born</div></div>
</div>

<p>He was born on or about March 31st, 1685<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> at
Eisenach in Thuringia, under the shadow of the famous
Wartburg. A house still standing in the Frauenplan is
pointed out by tradition as his birthplace, and contains
a tablet to that effect. He was the youngest son of
John Ambrosius Bach, at that time Court and Town
musician of Eisenach, a place which had a good reputation
for its music.</p>

<p>The lofty artistic and moral standard which permeated
the whole of the numerous members of the Bach family
seems to have culminated in the subject of this sketch.
We have seen that for many generations they had been
musicians, and had held the chief posts as organists and
town musicians throughout Thuringia; and John Sebastian
naturally had no other thought than to follow the family
profession. Of the first few years of his life little is known.
It is probable that he learned the violin from his father.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Goes to
Ohrdruf</i></div>

<div>In January 1695, when he was not yet ten years old,
his father died, and his eldest brother Johann Christoph,
who was organist of St Michael’s Church at
Ohrdruf and had married, now undertook to
provide for him and educate him. Johann
Christoph, who had been a pupil of Pachelbel for three
years, taught his younger brother the harpsichord.
Sebastian soon mastered all the studies and pieces he
was given to learn, and began to aspire to higher things.

<div class="sidenote">Boyhood Promise</div>
His brother had made a MS. collection of compositions
by Froberger, Fischer, Kerl, Buxtehude, Pachelbel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
Bruhns, Böhm, and others, and this book was eagerly
yearned for by Sebastian. The MS. was kept in a bookcase,
shut in with a wire lattice-work, and his brother for
some unknown reason denied him the use of it. Such
was his zeal, however, that he managed to abstract it
through the lattice-work, night after night, for six months,
until he had copied the whole of it by moonlight! His
pleasure in it was of short duration, for when he began to
practise the music his brother discovered the copy, and
was hard-hearted enough to confiscate it. No reason is
assigned for his having done so, and Sebastian did not
recover it until his brother’s death in 1721.</div>

<p>At Ohrdruf he joined the Lyceum,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> where he laid the
foundation of his general education, in Latin, Greek (from
the New Testament), theology, rhetoric and arithmetic.
He also took part in the chorus, whose duties were to
perform in church on Sundays and festivals, as well as to
sing motets at weddings and funerals, and at certain times
to sing in the streets.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> He became one of the principal
singers, and had a fixed salary.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 422px;">
<a href="images/illot022ah.jpg">
<img src="images/illot022as.jpg" class="picture" width="422" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><div>St Michael’s Church, Ohrdruf with the Lyceum, now the Burgerschule</div></div>
</div>



<div class="sidenote"><i>Thrown on
his own
resources</i></div>

<p>When he was fifteen he was obliged to leave his
brother’s house, and he now determined to make his
own way independently of assistance from
others. Recommended by Herda, the cantor
of the Lyceum, he went to the school of
the convent of St Michael at Lüneburg,
accompanied by his friend Georg Erdmann, about Easter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
1700, and both were admitted to the choir as discantists
with a salary. Bach’s voice soon broke, but he remained
three years at Lüneburg as accompanist at rehearsals,
besides playing the violin when required and taking
part in the band that played through the streets at
the New Year. His salary was probably twelve thalers
a year, besides free board and lodging, and a share
in the profits of the processional performances in the
streets.</p>

<p>Lüneburg, like Eisenach, seems to have cultivated
music with considerable energy. Besides the choir of
which Bach became a member, there was a similar one
belonging to the school of St John, and the rivalry
which naturally arose led to collisions, which were put an
end to by certain streets being allotted to each choir for
its performances.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Earnest Student</div>

<p>Bach, being now above want, devoted the whole of his
available time to self-improvement, in spite of the great
demands made on him by his duties. He found in the
library of the convent compositions by all the best composers
up to that period&mdash;Hammerschmidt, Scheidt,
Ahle, Briegel, Schütz, Rosenmüller, Michael, Schop, Jeep,
Krieger, Selle, Crüger, and his own relatives Heinrich and
John Christoph Bach. To these compositions we know
that he devoted unremitting study, and at the same time
worked with enormous industry day and night to improve
his technique on keyboard instruments.</p>

<p>The organist of St John’s Church was Böhm, a native
of Thuringia, and a man of considerable genius. He
had studied in Hamburg, and his compositions show the
influence of Sweelinck and of Reinken the organist of St
Catherine’s Church. The distinguishing characteristics of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
his school were “technical neatness, pleasing ingenuity,
and a taste for subtle effects of tone.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>Bach was now learning all he could from Böhm, but in
order to further advance himself he made several expeditions
to Hamburg on foot, a distance of some 25 English miles.</p>

<p>Of one of these expeditions the following story is
told. Bach, on his return journey, sat down outside an
inn halfway between the two cities with not sufficient
money in his pocket to avail himself of the excellent
dinner that was being prepared, the odours of which
reached him from the kitchen, when a window was
suddenly opened and two herrings’ heads were thrown
out. The herring in those days, as now, was one of the
favourite articles of food in Germany, and the boy at
once picked up the two heads. Inside each he found a
Danish ducat. Who his benefactor was never became
known to him; and the money not only paid for a
dinner, but another journey to Hamburg as well.</p>

<p>From Reinken he obtained models for his early compositions
of which Spitta mentions three as showing
Reinken’s influence; organ arrangements of the two
chorales “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es ist gewisslich an der Zeit</span>,”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> “An Wasserflüssen
Babylon”;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and a toccata in G.</p>

<p>But Bach was not satisfied to study only the works of
his own countrymen. About forty-five English miles to the
south of Lüneburg is Celle, where the ducal court maintained
a band which played French dance music, and
where also French harpsichord music was held in considerable
estimation. He took frequent opportunities of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
hearing this band, and so became familiar with the French
style of music, which he admired, and much of which
he copied.</p>

<p>Spitta considers that the chorale partitas “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christ, der
du bist der helle Tag</span>,” and “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">O Gott, du frommer Gott</span>,”<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
were composed at Lüneburg, since they were certainly
early works, and show the influence of Böhm, in the
elaboration of the motives and the use of <i>basso ostinato</i>,
&amp;c. It would seem that there was no good organ at
Lüneburg, for his compositions of this period are either
for harpsichord or, if for organ, show that he was not yet
experienced in writing for the latter instrument.</p>

<p>In 1703 Bach was invited by Johann Ernst, younger
brother of Duke Wilhelm Ernst, to join his orchestra
at Weimar as a violinist with the title of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hof-musikus</span>,”
or Court musician. This brought him into contact with
a great deal of instrumental music, especially Italian
works, and among musicians he there met Westhoff, the
Duke’s private secretary, a good violinist, and Johann
Effler an organist.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>First
appointment</i></div>

<p>From Weimar he paid a visit to Arnstadt, only a few
miles off, the former meeting-place of his family. Here
he had an opportunity of trying the organ lately erected
in the “New Church,” the organist of which was Börner,
a man of no great attainments. The Consistory heard
him, and, at once dismissing Börner, offered
Bach the post: a high-handed proceeding,
which they softened by making Börner
“organist at Matins” and deputy to the
Franciscan Church, on his full salary. Bach’s salary
was raised by outside contributions, and the youth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
eighteen found himself more highly paid than any of his
fellow officials.</p>

<p>On August 14th, 1703, he was solemnly installed, and
exhorted to industry and fidelity in his calling, and to act
as an honourable servant and organist before God, the
authorities, and his superiors. His official duties were to
play on Sunday and Thursday mornings, and at one service
on Mondays; so that he had ample leisure for study.</p>

<p>The keyboards, of which we give a photograph, are
preserved in the Rathhaus. The instrument was built
by Wender of Mühlhausen in 1703.</p>

<p>Bach had also the direction of a small school choir,
which was augmented by “adjuvanten” or amateur singers,
and he had to accompany and attend the rehearsals of
the church choir, besides which he probably played the
violin in the Count’s band. There was also a theatre
belonging to the Count, in which “Singspielen” or
operettas were occasionally performed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>First
Cantata</i></div>

<p>The cantata for the first day of Easter, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Denn du wirst
meine Seele nicht in der Hölle lassen</span>,” which was afterwards
remodelled for use at Leipsic, was composed
at Arnstadt, probably for Easter 1704.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
It was his first cantata, and is in character
similar to those in vogue in Northern Germany.</p>

<p>It consists of a short introductory sonata, for three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
trumpets, drums, strings and organ, then a bass solo,
“For thou shalt not leave my soul in hell,” in which
are important ritornels. This is followed by a recitative,
a duet for soprano and alto in Italian aria form,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
a tenor solo, “Be not dismayed,” after which the cantata
closes with a soprano aria, “Up soul, and be joyful.”</p>

<p>During his stay at Arnstadt he chiefly cultivated
instrumental music and composition, and, according to
Mizler, began to show his eminence in organ-playing.</p>

<p>In 1704, Johann Jacob, Sebastian’s elder brother, who
had entered the Swedish Guard as an oboe-player, came
to bid farewell to his family and friends. For him Bach
wrote the early “capriccio on the departure of his beloved
brother.” This was modelled on Johann Kuhnau’s “Bible
Sonatas.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>A chorale arrangement for two manuals and pedals
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wie schön leuchtet uns der Morgenstern</span>” of this period
exists in MS. in the R. Library at Berlin, and seventeen
variations on “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr</span>” were in
the possession of the late Dr Rust of Leipsic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Visit to
Lübeck</i></div>

<p>Towards the end of 1705 Bach determined to go to
Lübeck to hear and study the style of Buxtehude, one
of the greatest organists then living. He
found a deputy, and having obtained one
month’s leave of absence, started on foot,
on the journey of over 200 miles, with the object of
arriving in time to hear the “evening performances”
at the Marienkirche, which took place in November and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
December, which were peculiar to Lübeck, and which
Buxtehude had worked up to a high pitch of excellence.
They consisted of sacred music both vocal and instrumental,
with organ solos.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cited to Appear</div>

<p>Bach outstaid his leave of absence by some three
months, and on his return to Arnstadt in February 1706
received a “citation” to appear before the Consistory
to explain his conduct. The Consistory at the same
time brought a charge against him of neglecting the
training of the choir, and of introducing unseemly
variations on the organ during the singing of the chorale,
whereby the congregation were thrown into confusion;
and they complained of the great length and unseemly
figuration of his preludes to the chorales.</p>

<p>Bitter gives the whole of the report of this “citation,”
in which the several charges are put to Bach and
answered by him.</p>

<p>“The organist of the New Church, Bach, is required
to say where he has been for so long of late, and from
whom he received leave of absence?”</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“He has been to Lübeck in order to learn things
connected with his art, but that he had previously asked
permission from the Herr Superintendent.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Der Superintend.</span></p>

<p>“He had only asked permission for four weeks, but
had remained away four times as long as that.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Hopes that the organ would have been played by
him whom he had put in, in such a manner that no
complaint can be made on that point.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Nos.</span></p>

<p>“Charge him with having made extraordinary variations
in the chorales, and with intermixing many
strange sounds, so that thereby the congregation were
confounded. He must in the future, when he wishes to
introduce some <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tonus peregrinus</i>, continue in it, and not
go off too quickly to something else, or, as he had
hitherto been in the habit of doing, play a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tonum contrarium</i>.
And then it is very strange that up to this
time he has had no rehearsals, because he will not agree
with the scholars. Therefore he is to declare whether he
will play both figural and choral music with the scholars,
since a capellmeister cannot be kept. If he will not do
this, let him say so categorically of his own accord, that
a change may be made, and some one who will undertake
it can be appointed to the post.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“If an honest Director be appointed, he will play
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>



<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Resolvitur.</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Explanations Needed</div>

<p>“He must explain his conduct within eight days.
That scholar Rambach (the choir prefect) now appear,
and be reproved for the disorders which up to this time
have taken place between the scholars and the organist
of the New Church.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“The organist, Bach, played for too long a time,
but after this was notified to him, by the Herr Superintendent,
he at once went quite to the opposite extreme
and has made it too short.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Accuse him (Rambach) of having gone to a wine-cellar
last Sunday during the sermon.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Was very sorry, and it should never happen again,
and the clergy have already spoken to him very severely
about it. The organist need not complain of him about
the conducting, because it was undertaken not by him,
but by the youth Schmidt.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Nos.</span></p>

<p>“He must for the future behave quite differently and
better, otherwise the gift which was intended for him
would be withheld. If he has anything to remember
against the organist, he must bring it forward at the
proper place, and not take the law into his own hands,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
but behave in such a way as to give satisfaction, as
he had promised. The servant of the Court is now
ordered to tell the Rector to have Rambach imprisoned
on four successive days for two hours each day.”</p>

<p>Bach was always irritable and obstinate, and had
completely alienated his choir. He was too much
engaged in composition to take any interest in training
it, and it was in any case not good enough for him.
The Consistory allowed that there were faults on both
sides, and hoped that by giving him more time than the
eight days he would come to some agreement with the
choir: but in vain. For Bach having come fresh from
the artistic life of Lübeck found the drudgery of training
the rough scholars unbearable. The answer that he was
required to give in eight days completely left his mind,
and after more than eight months the Consistory again
“represented to the organist Bach that he should declare
whether, as he has been ordered to do, he will rehearse
with the scholars or not; as, if he feels no shame in
remaining in the Church and receiving the salary, he
must also not be ashamed to ‘make music’ (<i>i.e.</i> rehearse)
with the scholars: for it is intended that these should
exercise themselves, so that for the future they may have
more skill in music.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Will make the declaration on this subject in writing.”</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Furthermore ask him by what power he has latterly
allowed the strange maiden to appear, and to make music
in the choir.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ille.</span></p>

<p>“Has already spoken about it to Master Uthe.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>The “strange maiden” who made music with Bach in
private in the church seems to have been his cousin,
Maria Barbara, youngest daughter of Michael Bach of
Gehren,<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> whom he married in the following year. It is
not known how the matter ended, but Bach, from this
time, began to endeavour to find another post.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Second
appointment</i></div>

<p>An important post at St Blasius, Mühlhausen, some
20 miles north of Gotha, fell vacant through the death
of Johann Georg Ahle on December 2nd, 1706, and
there were many candidates. It seems, from
Gerber’s account (vol. ii. p. 764), to have
been at first offered to Johann Gottfried
Walther of Erfurt, but to have been declined
by him;<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> and when Bach, whose friction with the Consistory
made him anxious to leave Arnstadt, offered
himself as a candidate, the Council, after hearing him play,
were unanimous in his favour.</p>

<p>The church of St Blasius is a fine Gothic building, in
strong contrast to the homely, towerless New Church at
Arnstadt; and the office of organist is proportionately
more important. Its present holder is Herr Musikdirector
Möller.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

with Marchand.</p></div>


<p>The competition took place at Easter 1707, and terms
were arranged a month later. An organist is rarely a
highly paid individual: but modern organists may well be
astonished at the meagreness of the salary for which the
greatest of their predecessors was content to work. The
request for the loan of a cart to bring his modest furniture
from Arnstadt brings the matter very plainly before us.
One sees in Thuringia, even at the present day, the
clumsy four-wheel carts which have not varied in shape
for centuries, drawn by a cow and a pony, rarely by two
horses; and one can easily imagine such a cart conveying
the household goods of the young musician across the
plain from Arnstadt to Gotha, and from Gotha to Mühlhausen.</p>

<p>The terms were eighty-five gülden (about £8, 10s.);
three malter (twelve bushels) of corn, two cords of wood,
six trusses of brushwood; the last in place of some arable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
land formerly held by the organist. The cost of conveyance
to his door was to be borne by the Council. In
addition, he was to receive annually three pounds of
fish, and he asked that a cart might be lent him for
transporting his furniture from Arnstadt, to which request
the Council agreed.</p>

<p>A fire had, a fortnight before, destroyed a large portion
of the parish of St Blasius, and when the clerk brought
the agreement to the Council to sign, pens and ink were
not forthcoming, so that a verbal agreement was made to
all the terms.</p>

<p>The actual appointment took place on June 15th; and
a fortnight later he was again in Arnstadt, where he
thanked the Council for past favours, announced his
resignation, and gave up the key of the organ. A sum
of five gülden was due to him as salary, but he requested
the Consistory to pay this to his cousin Ernst,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> who had
formerly assisted him, but who was now ill and poor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Work at
Mühlhausen</i></div>

<p>His duties at St Blasius were to play the organ on
Sundays, saints’ days and festivals. He was anxious to
raise the whole of the church music to a higher level, and
mentioned this wish to the Council in an
address. His predecessor Ahle had left a
number of compositions which were frequently
performed, but Bach, not being satisfied
with them, as quickly as possible made a good collection
of music and had it performed, paying for it out of his
own pocket. He also made efforts to improve the choir
and orchestra.</p>

<p>He received considerable assistance in these endeavours
from his pupil Johann Martin Schubart (who afterwards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
succeeded him in his post at Weimar), and from his choir
leader, Johann Sebastian Koch, afterwards Capellmeister
to Count Reuss, and a Bachelor of Theology at Jena
University.</p>

<p>In October 1707, Bach returned to Arnstadt for his
wedding, which took place on the 17th of that month,
and it is evident that he had parted on good terms with the
Consistory, for the prescribed fees were remitted. In
September of the same year Tobias Lämmerhirt, of Erfurt,
a maternal uncle of Sebastian, had died, and left 50
gülden (about £5) to each of his sister’s children, and
this legacy must have been welcome to Sebastian at the
time of his wedding.</p>

<p>Among the duties expected of the organist of St Blasius,
was the composition of a cantata for the yearly change of
Town Council (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rathswahl</span>); and it was customary to
have the music printed after the performance, at Mühlhausen.</p>

<p>The first of the cantatas thus composed by Bach is
preserved; it was for the festival of 1708, and was performed
in the Church of the Holy Virgin on February 4
of that year. The text is taken from the Old Testament,
together with part of a hymn or a chorale, and Bach
called it a motet. It was accompanied by three trumpets,
drums, two flutes, two oboes, a bassoon and strings, the
band being divided into four groups of brass, wood-wind
(with cello), reed, and strings. The form is in imitation
of some of Buxtehude’s church cantatas.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">St Blasius Organ</div>

<p>Bach found the organ of St Blasius in very bad con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>dition.
It had not sufficient bellows, and there was insufficient
pressure on the bass pipes, owing to there being
too small a wind passage. There was no 32 feet stop and
the trombone was too weak. Moreover the choir-organ
had become useless, as had also several stops in the great.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Repairs the
organ</i></div>

<p>He drew up a list of deficiencies which he presented
to the Council, and asked for the addition of a “Glockenspiel”
or peal of bells, to be acted on by pedals, an
invention of his own. The latter addition was at once
subscribed for by the parishioners. There
was a smaller organ in the church, which
he proposed to sell and apply the proceeds
to repairing the principal organ. The Council placed
the entire management of the matter in his hands, and
he obtained an estimate from Wender the organ-builder
who agreed to do the work for 230 thalers,<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> and to allow
40 thalers for the small organ.</p>

<p>The requirements were:&mdash;</p>

<p>Three new bellows; stronger wind to the four old ones,<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>
a new 32 feet stop with a separate wind chest for it;
renewal of the old bass wind chests; new and larger
pipes, with differently arranged mouthpieces for the bass
trombone; the addition of the new glockenspiel of twenty-four
bells; the trumpet on the great to be removed and
a 16 feet bassoon to take its place; the gemshorn to be
changed for a viol da gamba of 8 feet; a 3 feet nassat to
be put in instead of the quint; revoicing of all the rest
of the pipes; sundry alterations in the choir-organ; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
a coupler to connect it with the third manual; the tremulant
to be put in working order.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, difficulties soon began to arise.
He was looked upon as an outsider, for the post had
previously always been held by a native; and obstacles
which appeared insurmountable soon began to beset
him. Religious differences arose between the “Pietists”
and the “Old Lutherans,” the former being led by J.A.Frohne,
dean of Mühlhausen, and the latter by G.C.
Eilmar, archdeacon of the Church of the Blessed Virgin.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pietist view
of music</i></div>

<p>Bach sided with the orthodox Lutherans, and Eilmar
was godfather to his first child. The Pietists conceived
of art as part of “the world,” and therefore absolutely
hostile to a Christian life: it could only be rightly used
in religion, and then only in the narrowest
possible of “spiritual songs” from which all
expression must be excluded. Hence any
attempt to introduce higher forms or new ideas must
be sinful. It is easily seen, therefore, that Frohne would
naturally place what obstacles he could in the way of
Bach’s endeavours to raise church music to the highest
possible artistic standard. Moreover, the Pietists were
opposed to the doctrine of regeneration by baptism, and
to the whole of the simple but truly religious views which
Bach had inherited from generations of his family,
dedicated to the work of the church as organists and
cantors. He was no theologian, and was perfectly content
with the faith of his fathers.</p>

<p>The most beautiful and deeply religious of his church
cantatas were a sinful abomination in the eyes of the
Pietists. What wonder then that he should have found
difficulties and obstacles and want of appreciation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
carrying out his aims. Even while he was in the midst
of the interesting work of repairing his organ, the situation
began to become intolerable, and a post at Weimar
falling vacant, he took steps to obtain it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Resigns
his post</i></div>

<p>On June 5 he went to Arnstadt for the second
wedding of his friend Pastor Stauber, who had performed
the service a year before at Bach’s own wedding, and on
June 25th 1708 he sent in his resignation to the Council
at Mühlhausen, a year after he had received
the appointment. He had always been on
the best of terms with them, and it is evident,
from the tone of his letter of resignation, that he was
sorry to leave them. The Council on their side also
regretted the step, but granted his dismissal, only requiring
that he should supervise the repairs to the organ,
which were not completed till 1709.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Third
appointment</i></div>

<p>The post at Weimar, which he now obtained, was that
of Court-organist and chamber-musician to Duke Wilhelm
Ernst of Saxe-Weimar. Forkel says that he made a
journey to Weimar, and so pleased the Duke
with his organ-playing, that the post was at
once offered to, and accepted by him.
“Here,” says Hilgenfeldt, “he devoted himself
to acquiring that overwhelming mastery of the
organ for which his fame is assured for all time: and he
also laid the foundation for his future greatness as a
composer.”</p>

<p>His circumstances were now very favourable. His
employer was a man of wide culture and refinement,
deeply interested in music and other branches of art, but
more particularly in church music. He was religious,
and took much interest in religious matters; and in all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
things he and Bach were in the closest sympathy. Bach’s
position at Weimar was much the same as that of Franz
Liszt at the same Court in the nineteenth century.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a>
It is interesting to observe how this small and poor
Court for such a long period was famous for its encouragement
of art and literature. Bach in the first decades of
the eighteenth century, Goethe and Schiller in the last
quarter of the eighteenth and first part of the nineteenth,
Liszt and Wagner later on, besides many lesser men,
received help and encouragement at this remarkable
Thuringian “Residenz.”</p>

<p>Bach, as we have seen, was appointed organist and
“Kammermusikus” (chamber-musician)&mdash;his salary for
the first three years being 156 gülden, 15 groschen
(£15, 13s. 3d.), which was always punctually paid,
but in 1711, 1713, and 1714 it was considerably increased.</p>

<p>The organ of the castle was small, but had a good
pedal. There were 9 stops on the Great, 8 on the
Choir, and 7 on the Pedal. The pitch was a minor third
below the kammerton or ordinary pitch.</p>

<p>As Kammermusikus Bach played the harpsichord and
violin, and afterwards became “Concertmeister” or
leader. The number of musicians was about twenty-two,
including singers, but the latter could also play some
instruments, and many members of the band performed
on several. The orchestra would also be occasionally
strengthened by the addition of the town musicians.
Johann G. Walther was organist of the town church, and
a great friendship sprang up between the two men. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
was connected with Bach by marriage, his mother being
a Lämmerhirt. One of his chorales has been erroneously
ascribed to Bach. It is Peters, vol. 245, Book vi., No.
24&mdash;“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gott der Vater wohn’ uns bei</span>.”</p>

<p>Bach stood godfather to Walther’s eldest son, and a
friendly rivalry in composition arose between them. Later
on, however, some unfortunate disagreement seems to
have arisen between the friends, for Walther, in his
Lexicon, omits the mention of events and compositions
during the nine years’ period at Weimar, which must
have been well known to him.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sight-Reading Poser</div>

<p>Forkel tells the following anecdote:&mdash;Bach, while still
at Weimar, had advanced so far in clavier playing that he
said to a friend that he believed he could play anything at
first sight. His friend invited him to breakfast in a week’s
time, and for a joke placed on the harpsichord a newly
composed piece which looked simple enough. While
the friend was preparing breakfast in the next room,
Bach instinctively began playing what he saw on the
harpsichord, but was not able to advance very far. He
tried several times, but always with the same result. On
joining his friend, he laughingly acknowledged that no
one could play everything at first sight, it was not
possible.</p>

<p>Amongst other things Bach began to study Italian
instrumental music at Weimar, especially with regard to
the forms then in use, the concerto, the suite and the
sonata. To this period may therefore perhaps be assigned
some of the concertos for clavecin and other instruments,
the suites for violin, etc., and the sonatas for harpsichord
and violin.</p>

<p>The sonata of this date was usually performed by two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
violins and a violoncello, with a figured bass part for a
harpsichord or organ (<i>e.g.</i> the twelve sonatas of Purcell in
Italian style, and the four sets of twelve sonatas each by
Corelli op. 1, 2, 3, 4). These sonatas had nothing in
common with the modern sonata as begun by Emanuel
Bach and perfected by Haydn, Mozart, and Beethoven.</p>

<p>Bach has left some examples in the sonatas for two
violins and clavier (Peters, 237); for flute, violin, and
clavier (Peters, 237): by clavier must be understood here
a part for figured bass, which would be played by violincello
or double bass and harpsichord. Besides this, he
adopted the form for other combinations, such as violin
and figured bass, flute and figured bass (Peters, 232 to
235) viola da gamba and figured bass, etc. (Peters, 239).</p>

<p>Bach and Walther had plenty of encouragement in this
kind of music, since the Duke’s nephew Joh. Ernst (who
unfortunately died young) had considerable skill on the
violin, and also was a fair composer. They vied with
one another in arranging Italian concertos for the harpsichord
and organ. Sixteen of Vivaldi’s violin concertos
were arranged by Bach for the harpsichord (Peters, 217)
and three for the organ (Peters, 247).<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Walther arranged
thirteen for organ from the works of Torelli, Taglietti,
Albinoni, etc., and they are preserved in MS. in the
Royal Library at Berlin. The arranging of these concertos
led Bach to the use of the new form for clavier
compositions, of which the well-known Italian concerto is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
an example. Is it possible that the friendly rivalry was
the commencement of the estrangement with Walther?</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Artistic
journeys</i></div>

<p>Bach was in the habit of making expeditions to try
different organs, or for other musical purposes, and his
reputation began to spread through North and
Central Germany. He invented a peculiar
form of fingering for keyboard instruments
in order to increase his facility, and his use of the
pedal rose to unheard-of heights. He also became an
expert in questions of organ construction, and was often
called upon to give his opinion in this respect. He
was very ingenious in his use of the stops and of artistic
combinations, but, unfortunately, with one small exception,
none of his registering has come down to us.
He was never in command of a really fine instrument,
and the above exception, which consists of the chorale
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein feste Burg</span>,” Peters, vol. vi., No. 22, seems to
have been written for the newly arranged organ at Mühlhausen.
It is for three manuals&mdash;the left hand has to play
on a “fagott,” and over the right hand is written “sesquialtera.”
These directions are omitted in Peters’ edition,
but are given in Walther’s collection at Königsberg.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Halle Incident</div>

<p>In 1713 he went to Halle, where a large organ of
sixty-three stops had recently been placed in the Liebfrauenkirche.
Here he won laurels by his magnificent
playing, and, since the post was vacant through the
death of F. W. Zachau, he offered his services to the
Council as organist. He remained long enough to go
through the prescribed test of composing and conducting
a cantata, after which he returned to Weimar in haste
to fulfil his engagements. The authorities of the church
wrote to him stating the salary and conditions, but Bach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
considering that the payment was inadequate to the
amount of work, returned the agreement they had sent
him to sign. The Halle authorities then said that Bach
had only opened the negotiations in order to obtain an
increase of salary at Weimar. This naturally annoyed
him, and drew from him a firm and dignified answer to
the affront.</p>

<p>In 1714 Bach went to Cassel to try an organ, which
had been recently renovated. His extraordinary execution,
especially on the pedals, so astonished the Crown
Prince Friedrich (afterwards King of Sweden) that he
drew a valuable ring from his finger and presented it to
him.</p>

<p>On the first Sunday in Advent 1714 he paid his first
visit to Leipsic, where he conducted his cantata, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Nun
Komm, der Heiden Heiland</span>,” and made the acquaintance
of Kuhnau, Cantor of the Thomas Church, whose
works he much admired.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Order of
church
service</i></div>

<p>The autograph score of this cantata is still in existence,
and on it is noted, in Bach’s own hand, the order of the
service in just the same way as any modern organist, who
was taking a service in a strange church, would note it.
The order on this occasion was a prelude
on the organ, then a motet, then the kyrie,
which was preceded by a prelude on the
organ. Then came the epistle, the litany
(which was sung), and the prelude to the chorale. Then
the gospel, and after this the cantata, which was also preceded
by a prelude. To this followed the sermon, then
the Communion, during which he had to extemporise
another prelude to a chorale, and the service concluded
with a voluntary on the organ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>The organ solo portions of the service were all called
“Preludes”; and it does not seem that a concluding
“voluntary” was usual. The prelude was played at
the beginning of the service, and before the chorales.
With us it is customary to simply play through the tune
of a hymn or chant, in order to let the congregation know
what they are to sing, and to give them time to find their
places in the books. In Germany an artistic and somewhat
elaborate prelude, in which the organist is expected to
show his skill, precedes each chorale.</p>

<p>A hymn was sung between the epistle and gospel, in
the place of the “Gradual” of the Roman service, and
here the most elaborate prelude was introduced, based on
the melody of the hymn.</p>

<p>Before the “church music,” which takes the place of
our anthem, an extempore prelude was played in order to
allow the instruments to be tuned. This was in the form
of a fantasia, in which the performer had to remain longest
in the key which most coincided with the strings to be
tuned. The prelude had to stop on a sign from the
conductor that the instrumentalists were ready. It was
supposed to have some connection with the piece that
was to follow, but the unhappy effusions of incompetent
organists led to occasional remonstrance from the
Council.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Examination
of a
new organ</i></div>

<p>In 1716 the Council of the Liebfrauenkirche at Halle
invited him to examine their organ, which was
now completed. He answered their invitation
very politely, and with Kuhnau of Leipsic and
Ch. F. Rolle of Quedlinburg began the examination
in the second week after Easter. The organ
was built by Cuncius of Halberstadt, and the three ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>aminers
reported that he had carried out the work (which
had occupied three years) in the most satisfactory way
possible, the only part requiring alteration being the
bellows. After many difficulties, owing to the smallness
of the salary, the authorities eventually found an efficient
organist in G. Kirchoff, a pupil of Zachau and a man of
the same age as Bach.</p>

<p>About 1716 the friend of Bach’s youth, G. Erdmann,
visited him. He had held a legal post under the Russian
government since 1713.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Contest
with
Marchand</i></div>

<p>In the autumn of 1717 Bach made a journey to
Dresden to hear the performances at the theatre, which
was supported by Friedrich August I. There happened
to be visiting Dresden a famous French organist and
harpsichord player Jean Louis Marchand,
organist at Versailles, and of several churches
at Paris. He enjoyed an immense reputation
as player and composer, though his
compositions have not borne the test of time, and are
now entirely forgotten. Vain, arrogant, and conceited,
the spoilt idol of French society, he came to Dresden,
where his playing became much in favour at the Court
and he was given two medals. Soon after Bach’s
arrival there arose a discussion among the artists as to
which was the greater performer. The Court musicians
took the part of Marchand, while the members of the
orchestra, who were mostly Germans, preferred Bach.
The matter ended in Bach’s being persuaded by his
friends to write to Marchand, offering to go through
any musical test that Marchand might suggest, on condition
that he would undergo the same test.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Victory</div>

<p>The challenge was accepted; a date was fixed for a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
meeting at the house of Field Marshal von Flemming,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
a jury of musicians was chosen, and a brilliant company
assembled. Bach and the jury arrived punctually, but
Marchand did not appear. After a time he was sent
for, when it was found that he had departed by express
coach that morning from Dresden, certain, no doubt,
of being defeated. Marchand seems to have heard
Bach privately beforehand; while Bach was already
familiar with Marchand’s works, and admired them
much. Spitta<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> considers that they are not inferior to
those of Couperin in variety and grace, but are rather
thin for the more solid German taste. The news of
Bach’s victory soon spread far and wide, and did much
to enhance his already great reputation. He, however,
never seems to have obtained any recognition from the
Court at Dresden.</p>

<p>Bach returned from Dresden to prepare for a jubilee at
Weimar, in commemoration of the two hundredth anniversary
of the Reformation. The festival took place from
October 31st to November 2nd, and for it Bach composed
at least one cantata and perhaps two. On this
occasion the Duke established a fund, of which the
interest was to be distributed yearly, the Court organist
to receive 3 gülden from it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fourth
appointment</i></div>

<p>The old capellmeister, Samuel Drese, had for twenty
years been too much out of health to fulfil his duties.
The duke, however, would not dismiss him, but gave
him a deputy, G. C. Strattner, at a salary of 200
gülden. Drese died on December 1, 1716, and it
would seem natural that Bach should be appointed in
his place. For some reason, however, he
was passed over, and Drese’s son (who had
succeeded Strattner as deputy capellmeister)
was installed. Bach, therefore, accepted an
offer made by Prince Leopold of Anhalt-Cöthen of a
capellmeister-ship, and in November 1717 moved to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Cöthen. His post at the Weimar Castle organ was
filled by his pupil Schubart.</p>

<p>Amongst Bach’s duties at Weimar was that of composing
and conducting a certain number of sacred pieces
every year, to texts by Franck, the secretary to the
Superior Consistory of the Principality of Weimar, and
librarian to the duke. Franck was a good poet, and
had written excellent masques, besides occasional pieces
for weddings, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pupils</i></div>

<p>Bach’s fine playing naturally attracted many pupils. In
those days there were no Conservatoires or Academies
of Music; and pupils were “articled,” as in
our own country, to eminent organists, taking
much the same place as apprentices in any trade&mdash;in fact,
they were called apprentices. His first pupil, who was
also his amanuensis, was J. M. Schubart; of J. C. Vogler,
Gerber says that Bach considered him his best organ pupil.
He became Court organist and burgomaster of Weimar.</p>

<p>Another pupil was Joh. T. Krebs, who, however, did
not begin studying till he was married and had already
a post as organist at Buttestädt near Weimar, whence he
used to walk weekly to Weimar, for seven years, to obtain
instruction from Walther, and afterwards from Bach.</p>

<p>Krebs’ son, Joh. Ludwig, became a pupil of Bach at
Leipsic at the age of thirteen, and Bach had a very high
opinion of him. He received the appointment of organist
of Buttestädt. According to Gerber, he was Bach’s pupil
and assistant at the harpsichord for nine years, and was
second only to Vogler in eminence.</p>

<p>In repayment for his elder brother’s care at Ohrdruf,
Bach took charge of his nephew Bernhard<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> at Easter, 1715,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
teaching him the clavier and composition. Bernhard afterwards
was appointed organist of Ohrdruf, in succession to
his father. Some of his compositions still exist in MS.
and show the influence of his uncle.</p>

<p>Bach’s duties at Cöthen did not comprise any organ
playing or church music: in fact, he never held an
organistship after he left Weimar. The organ of the
castle was merely a little chamber instrument, with only
thirteen stops, of which ten belonged to the two manuals
and three to the pedals.</p>

<p>The Prince was highly cultivated, with a great taste
for music, which had been developed by travels in Italy.
After the custom of German princes of that time, he
became a patron of art, practising it himself. Spitta
(vol. ii. p. 3) infers from an inventory in the ducal
archives at Cöthen, that he played the violin, gamba,
and harpsichord.</p>

<p>There is no sign of there having been a trained chorus
at Cöthen. One of the members of the band was Chr. F.
Abel, who afterwards became famous as a viola-da-gambist,
while his second son Karl Friedrich was the well-known
virtuoso on this instrument.</p>

<p>J. Schneider became a pupil of Bach’s at this time.
He was a violinist in the band, but afterwards became
organist of the Nicolai-church at Leipsic. Bach’s salary
here amounted to 400 thalers (about £60); it commenced
from August 1, though he remained in office at
Weimar until November.</p>

<p>The private performances at the castle were full of
zeal for art. The Prince would not part with Bach,
even for a short time, and took him on his journeys;
Bach reciprocated this feeling, and cherished his memory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
after his early death. In the Royal Library at Berlin
is the autograph of a serenade written for the
Prince’s birthday. It is scored for soprano and bass
solo voices, string band, harpsichord, two flutes and
one bassoon: this being the entire resources available.
The words, which are very meagre, are by an unknown
author, probably Bach himself. The cantata itself
is not published, but its music is used with other
words in the Whitsuntide Cantata “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Erhöhtes Fleisch
und Blut</span>.”<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>In May 1718, and again in 1720, Bach and six
members of the orchestra accompanied the Prince to
Carlsbad. In November 1718 the Prince and his
younger brother and sister stood god-parents to Bach’s
seventh child, Leopold August, who died in the following
year. The fact of so many high personages standing
sponsor to this child is a proof of the estimation
in which the Prince’s capellmeister was held.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Examines a
new organ
at Leipsic</i></div>

<p>Bach’s artistic journeys were continued from time to
time, and on December 16, 1717, he found himself at
Leipsic again, in response to an invitation to
examine a large new organ recently erected
in the University Church of St Paul. The
builder was Johann Scheibe, and Bach
declared it to be one of the best organs in Germany.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Death of
first wife</i></div>

<p>In July 1720, on his return from the second visit with
Prince Leopold to Carlsbad, he was met with the terrible
news that his wife had died, and had been
buried on the 7th of that month. She was
only thirty-six, and was in good health when
he left her. She had borne him seven children, had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
the best of companions, and was keenly sympathetic
towards her husband’s work.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Visit to
Hamburg</i></div>

<p>He went to Hamburg to perform a new cantata on the
text “He that exalteth himself shall be abased, and he
that humbleth himself shall be exalted,”
in November 1720. He found Reinken
still playing the organ of St Catherine,
though now ninety-seven years old. Reinken, though
a very great artist, was vain, and jealous, and it was
a question how he would receive Bach. Mattheson,
who did not love him, said that he was a “constant
admirer of the fair sex, and much addicted to the wine
cellar of the Council,” though he admitted that he had
no equal on the organ in his own style. Moreover, he
kept his instrument in excellent tune, and was always
talking of it. When Bach came, an appointment was
made, and he played for more than two hours, half an
hour of which was occupied in a masterly improvisation
on the chorale “By the waters of Babylon,” in motet
style. After the performance, at which the chief men
of the city were present, Reinken came to him, and
saying, “I thought this art was dead, but I perceive that
it still lives in you,” invited him to visit him, and treated
him with every attention. Reinken’s praise was the more
complimentary, because he himself had composed and
published a very successful arrangement of the same
chorale.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>The organ at St Catherine had four manuals and pedal,
with an abundance of good reeds, of which Bach was
fond (a specification is in Niedt, Mus. Handl. II., p. 176).
There was also a posaune, a 32 ft. open diapason, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
a mixture of 10 ranks. It dated from the sixteenth
century, and had been renovated in 1670 by Besser
of Brunswick.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>A still larger instrument was that of St James’ Church
in the same city, built by Arp Schnitker between 1688
and 1693, containing sixty stops, four manuals and pedal.
The organist of this church, H. Friese, had recently died,
and Bach, being tempted by the organ, and the prospect
of again having an opportunity of composing cantatas,
offered himself for the post.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Competes
for a post at
Hamburg</i></div>

<p>There were seven other candidates, the two most important
being a son of Vincentius Lübeck, and Wiedeburg,
capellmeister to the Count of Gera. An
examination was fixed for November 28, the
examiners being the elders of the church,
together with Gerstenbüttel the cantor,
Reinken, and two other Hamburg organists, Kniller and
Preuss. Wiedeburg, Lübeck and one other candidate
retired. The tests were performances of the two chorales
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">O lux beata Trinitas</span>,” and “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Helft mir Gott’s Güte
preisen</span>,” and an extemporised fugue on a given
theme.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Deceived</div>

<p>Bach could not wait for the examination, since his
duties at Cöthen required him to return home. He was,
however, excused having to submit to the test, on account
of his great reputation, and arranged to announce by
letter whether he would accept the post. He wrote in
the affirmative, though the contents of his letter are not
known. The committee had his letter publicly read, and
then elected an entirely unknown man, J. Joachim Heitmann,
who had done nothing for the art of music, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
who on January 6, 1721, paid to the treasury of the
church four thousand marks, which he had promised in
the event of his being elected. The committee came to
the conclusion that “the sale of a post of organist should
not become a custom, since it pertained to the service of
God; but if, after election, a person of his own free will
should show his gratitude by money payment, the church
should not refuse it.”</p>

<p>Neumeister, a famous preacher, who had not been able
to prevent this extraordinary transaction, left the committee
in anger. Mattheson thus describes the state of
public opinion when it became known.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> “I remember,
and no doubt other people still remember likewise, that
some years ago a great musician, who since then has, as
he deserves, obtained an important appointment as cantor,
appeared in a certain town of some size, boldly performed
on the largest and finest instruments, and attracted
universal admiration by his skill. At the same
time, among other inferior players, there offered himself
the son of a well-to-do artisan, who could prelude better
with thalers than with his fingers, and the office fell to
him, as may easily be guessed, although almost everyone
was angry about it. It was nigh upon Christmas-tide,
and an eloquent preacher, who had not consented to this
simony, expounded very beautifully the Gospel concerning
the angelic music at the birth of Christ, which very
naturally gave him the opportunity of expressing his
opinions as to the recent event as regarded the rejected
artist, and of ending his discourse with this noteworthy
epiphonema: ‘He believed quite certainly that if one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the angels of Bethlehem came from heaven, who played
divinely, and desired to be organist of St James’ Church,
if he had no money he would have nothing to do but to
fly away again.’”</p>

<p>Bach had no equal in Germany as an organ player&mdash;this
was soon admitted on all sides.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Handel’s fame had
reached Germany from England, both as a composer and
organ player. Comparisons were made between Handel’s
oratorios and Bach’s cantatas and Passion music&mdash;the
former were widely known, while the latter were hardly
yet appreciated, and were forgotten after the death of the
composer.</p>

<p>We have a contemporary opinion in Mattheson, who
had often heard Handel. “No one,” says he, “can easily
surpass Handel in organ playing, unless it were Bach of
Leipsic, for which reason these two are mentioned first,
out of their alphabetical order. I have heard them in
the prime of their powers, and have often competed with
the former both in Hamburg and Lübeck.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Handel,
however, did not devote himself so entirely to the organ
and organ compositions as Bach; he left no unaccompanied
solos for that instrument. Moreover, it is doubtful
if he found instruments of respectable size in England.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Endeavours
to meet
Handel</i></div>

<p>Bach and Handel never met, though they were twice
very near one another. Handel came to
Halle, his native town, in 1719, while on a
journey as <i>impresario</i> for the opera in London.
Bach hearing of it, made a journey to
Halle from Cöthen, but unfortunately arrived there the
very day Handel had left. In 1729, he made another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
attempt to meet Handel by sending him a polite invitation,
through his son Friedemann, to come to Leipsic; but
Handel refused the invitation. On a third visit of Handel
to Halle, Bach was dead. Bach greatly admired Handel’s
music, and copied some of it for his own use.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
second wife</i></div>

<p>We have seen that Bach’s first wife died in 1720. It was
not at all in accordance with the family traditions to remain
widower, and in 1721 he began to think of
re-marrying. He opened negotiations in this
year with Anna Magdalena Wülken, a Court
singer at Cöthen, twenty-one years old, and the youngest
daughter of the Court trumpeter, and was married to her
on December 3 in the same year.</p>

<p>Bach’s second wife was a good musician, and had a fine
soprano voice, which she used for the performance of her
husband’s works in the privacy of the home circle. She
had lessons from her husband in clavier and figured bass
playing, and also gave him immense help in copying
music; amongst other things, her MS. copy of a great
part of Handel’s <i>Passion-music</i> still exists.</p>

<p>Just before Bach’s second marriage the widow of his
uncle Tobias Lämmerhirt died, leaving him part of her
estate. This was the uncle who died just before Bach’s
first marriage, leaving him a legacy. The second accession
of money caused some trouble. The distribution
under the will of the widow was disputed in the names
of five relations, Joh. Christoph Bach of Ohrdruf, Joh.
Jacob Bach, Joh. Sebastian Bach, Maria Wiegand (born
Bach), and Anna Zimmermann (born Lämmerhirt). Unfortunately
for the petitioners, they had used the names
of the three Bachs without ever informing them. As a
matter of fact, Joh. Christoph was already dead, and Joh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
Jacob was in Sweden; Joh. Sebastian was most indignant
when he heard of it, and wrote to the Council of Erfurt
disclaiming both for himself and his brother all desire to
dispute the will; saying that they were perfectly satisfied
with their share, and that the petition was drawn up without
any notice being sent to them. The proceedings were
then dropped at once, and nothing more is heard of them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Little
Clavier
Book</i></div>

<p>Immediately after their marriage the Bachs started a MS.
music-book between them, entitled “Clavier Büchlein vor
Anna Magdalena Bachin, Anno 1720,” on
the first page of which is written a playful
inscription to the effect that the book was
directed against the Calvinism, and its attendant
melancholy and hostility to all art, which was
rife at Cöthen at this period. This book was followed in
1725 by a second and larger book; both are preserved in
the Royal Library at Berlin. The books contain various
clavier compositions by Bach, Böhm, Gerhard and others,
besides sundry hymns and sacred songs, also a song on
the reflections of a smoker; and others evidently addressed
to his wife, to whom he was devoted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Large Family</div>

<p>He had thirteen children, six sons and seven daughters,
by this wife; making, together with those by his first wife,
nineteen children in all.</p>

<p>Anna Magdalena’s portrait was painted by Cristofori,
and came into the possession of Philip Emanuel, but it
has now disappeared.</p>

<p>Most of his chamber music was written at Cöthen,
where he remained more than five years.</p>

<p>His position was so peaceful and pleasant that he proposed
to spend the rest of his life there. His prince was
in full sympathy with him, as we have seen. He had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
none of the contentions which seem to be almost inevitable
between an organist and his church authorities
when the organist wishes for anything beyond a mere
conventional standard of church music.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> He had nothing
to do with either the composition or performance of
church music; and if he had remained there the world
would have been the poorer by the <i>Passion-music</i> and
nearly all the cantatas. Fortunately for us, however, his
circumstances altered. His prince married a lady who
had no sympathy with music or its professors, and his
interest in music began to flag. After five years Bach
found himself again obliged to seek another post: and
he found one in which he remained till his death.</p>

School,

<p>Of the three ancient schools at Leipsic, St Thomas,
dating from the thirteenth century under the Augustines,
was the oldest and most important. It was
endowed with no less than fifty-four scholarships
for the encouragement of church music,
and its cantor was a person of considerable
importance, who ranked next below the Rector and
Conrector. These three officials, together with the chief
Latin master, were “Superiores,” who kept apart from the
“Inferiores” or lower masters. The cantor’s duty was to
teach singing for seven hours a week, to take the boys to
church on Thursdays at 7 o’clock in the morning, and to
give certain Latin lessons. He had also to take his turn
with the other Superiores in inspecting and examining the
boys for one week in four. The boys lived with them, and
the regulations of the school required all to get up at 5 in
summer, 6 in winter, to dine at 10, to have supper at 5,
to go to bed at 8.</p>

music every Sunday in four churches, St Thomas, St

chorales were sung, so that the younger singers sufficed for
this duty.</p>

<p>A motet or cantata was performed every Sunday at
the Thomas-Church and Nicolai-Church alternately: a
custom which still continues; the service is at 9 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, and
the cantata, which is always accompanied by the town
orchestra with the organ, takes somewhat the place of the
anthem in an English cathedral. The composition to be
performed on each Sunday is now announced in the
previous Saturday’s papers.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Office of Cantor</div>

<p>On great festivals the music was performed in both
churches at once, and twice a day. The cantor was
responsible for the music at one church, the choir
prefect for that at the other.</p>

<p>In order to lighten the work that this must have
imposed on the boys, the choir that sang at St Thomas
in the morning would sing the same music at St Nicholas
in the afternoon; and the cantata which was sung at St
Nicholas in the morning would be repeated at St Thomas
in the afternoon. The rehearsals took place on Saturday
afternoons from about 2.30 to 4.</p>

<p>Wedding and funeral music had also to be supplied
by the cantor. Moreover he had not only to choose the
music for these occasions, and teach it to the choir, but
appear in person to direct it, though he frequently left
the last duty to the prefect.</p>

<p>The choristers had to take part in certain processions at
Michaelmas, New Year, on St Martin’s and St Gregory’s
days: and these performances were conducted by the
prefects. For this purpose they were divided into four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
choirs, but the four choirs had only two or three voices
for each part. The cantor had to direct the music in
the two other churches, <i>i.e.</i> St John and St Paul, to inspect
their organs, and to superintend the town musicians
who took part in the church music.</p>

<p>The holidays consisted of one week during each of the
fairs,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> followed by a week of half-holidays. In the summer
four weeks of half-holidays. Morning lessons were
omitted on Saints’ days, funeral days, and academical
speech days. Four whole holidays in the year took place
on the “Name days” of the four principal masters.</p>

<p>In Lent no church music was performed, except on
the festival of the Annunciation; and on the last three
Sundays in Advent there was no church music.</p>

<p>The above list of holidays may seem at first sight
ample; but it had this great drawback: the masters were
never free, as in English schools, to go away for change
of scene. The boys appear to have lived with them
throughout the year. It is possible that German boys
do not cause so much anxiety to their masters as English
boys, and that work was not carried on at such high
pressure as nowadays; it is quite certain that no master
of an English public school could pursue his work continuously,
year after year, as these old Germans seem to
have done, without breaking down in health.</p>

<p>The cantor was provided with a residence in the school:
the salary was 100 gülden (about £13), but the whole
income from various sources amounted to about 700
thalers (about £100), together with certain allowances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
of corn, wine and firewood. A curious custom, though
not an uncommon one in those days, was, that certain
scholars twice a week went round the town to collect
donations for the school; and out of these, 6 pfennige
(about three farthings) per week were taken for each
scholar and divided between the four upper masters.
The moneys collected during the processional singing
in the streets, and also the fees paid for funerals and
weddings were divided according to certain fixed rules.
Bach mentions to Erdmann that when the air of Leipsic
is good there are few funerals, and therefore the cantor’s
income is smaller. Many efforts were made by the public
to evade these taxes, by holding funerals and weddings
without music; and there arose a certain feeling of indignation
that an important school and church official
should partly derive his means of subsistence from money
obtained by begging.</p>

<p>Owing to the insufficiency of accommodation the school
was a centre of illness, until the building was enlarged.</p>

<p>The Rector, Ernesti, was very old&mdash;he was a learned
man, but was not able to control either masters or boys.
The former quarrelled among themselves, and neglected
their duties; the boys were undisciplined, and the many
calls on their time for musical performances made their
education difficult. When Ernesti was appointed there
were one hundred and twenty boys in the lower school;
there were now only fifty-three.</p>

<p>The scholarships had plenty of applicants, but the better
class of citizens sent their sons to the other schools. The
lowest classes of the Thomas School consisted of boys of
the worst character, who went about the town barefoot
and begging.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Kuhnau’s
troubles</i></div>

<p>All reform which might result in curtailing his salary
was opposed by Ernesti, and the cantor seconded his
opposition. Things therefore grew worse and worse till
his death in 1729. In 1730 the superintendent reported
that the school had run wild, and that there were so few
scholars that it was proposed to close the lower classes
altogether. As to the singing, it must have been very
bad. The slow processions in the worst of weather, the
running up long flights of stairs to sing before the doors of
the higher “flats” ruined the voices. Kuhnau
complained in 1717 that the trebles lost their
voices before they had learned to use them.
In addition to this, they were undisciplined and often
feeble and miserable from illness, so that they did not
offer an attractive material for the cantor to work upon.</p>

<p>Kuhnau worked his hardest to remedy this state of
things, but without avail. In reply to his very reasonable
request that at least two trebles should be set apart for
church music only, and not allowed to run about the
streets and attend funerals for money, the Council
took no further steps than to allow 4 gülden for this
purpose, and that two boys should be released from the
winter processions.</p>

<p>When from 1693 to 1729 a house in the Brühl, one
of the chief streets of Leipsic, was used for the performance
of operas during the fairs, much damage was done to
the musical tendencies of the inhabitants of Leipsic. The
students of the University, who had formerly taken an
important part in the performance of the church cantatas,
now left Kuhnau (after he had been at the trouble of
training them), and joined the chorus of the opera. The
trouble was most acute when Telemann was organist of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
the Church of St Matthew. He had been a student in
the University, had composed an opera, and had formed
a musical society amongst the students. Looking upon
him as one of themselves, they entirely left Kuhnau,
who had to supply the music for the churches as best
he could. A new and operatic style of music came
into vogue under Telemann at St Matthew’s Church,
which became very popular; and his musical society
became the most important in Leipsic. There were
sixty members, who practised twice a week from 8 to
10 in the evening, and their performances, which took
place during fair time, became important. This “Musical
Union” practised in the coffee-houses, and members of
the public were admitted; its meetings had none of the
formality of school practice, but were cheerful and
attractive. Some of its better instrumentalists obtained
engagements in good bands, as at Dresden, Darmstadt,
Wolfenbüttel and Hamburg.</p>

<p>Telemann’s post, when he left, was successively occupied
by good musicians, and the union and opera were kept
up; the cantor had, in consequence, a hard time of it.
At festivals and fairs, when he was naturally anxious to
do well before the public, he had nothing to rely on but
a few inefficient town musicians and unruly schoolboys.</p>

<p>The organ at the Thomas Church was “belaboured
first by one, then by another pair of unwashed hands,”
the director of the music being either unable to play it,
or absent. Kuhnau begged that a regular organist should
be appointed, but he begged in vain. The Council, like
everyone else, were more interested in the attractions of
the opera than in the serious music of the two important
churches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">The Thomas School</div>

<p>At last even the boys took to the opera. Those who
had any voices got engaged by an <i>impresario</i>, ran away
from school, and returned only to appear in the theatre
during fair time, thus exciting the admiration and envy
of their former school-fellows. The music at the Thomas
School had reached its lowest ebb at the time of Kuhnau’s
death.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Successor
to Kuhnau</i></div>

<p>Kuhnau, the cantor of this School of St Thomas at
Leipsic, died on June 5, 1722. Six candidates applied
for the post&mdash;Fasch, a former pupil of Kuhnau, and now
capellmeister to the Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst;
Rolle, musical director at Magdeburg, and
formerly organist of Quedlinburg; Telemann,
who had composed cantatas for St Thomas’ Church, and
operas for the Leipsic theatre, cantor at Hamburg; G.
F. Kauffmann, a pupil of Buttstedt, and organist of Merseburg;
Graupner, capellmeister of Darmstadt; and Schott,
the organist of St Matthew’s Church at Leipsic.</p>

<p>Telemann was elected, and arrangements were made
for his installation, when he wrote from Hamburg that
he would not accept the office. The Council were
therefore, much against their will, obliged to elect
another, and their choice fell on Graupner, who had
been nine years a boy in the Thomas School, and was
a pupil of Kuhnau. He was considered one of the
best composers for the harpsichord of the day. He
was backed by strong recommendations and testimonials
from Heinichen, the capellmeister of Dresden, but the
Landgrave of Hesse-Darmstadt refusing to part with him,
he was forced to retire.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach offers
himself</i></div>

<p>At the end of 1722 Bach, after long and anxious
deliberation, offered himself for the appointment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>He did not wish to leave his comfortable post at
Cöthen, and moreover the position of cantor was
somewhat less dignified than the office of capellmeister.
On the other hand, the education of his sons
could be better carried out at Leipsic, and
the marriage of the Prince had to some
extent put him out of favour. After some three months’
hesitation, acting on the advice of friends, he went to
Leipsic and performed his test piece, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jesus nahm zu
sich die Zwölfe</span>” (Peters, 1290), on February 7, 1723.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Agreement</i></div>

<p>On the retirement of Graupner Bach was chosen, with
the proviso that if he could not teach all the Latin
required, they would pay a deputy to do it for him. Not
wishing to be behind his predecessor Kuhnau, he undertook
all the duties, but soon finding the Latin too much
of a task, he paid his colleague Pezold 50 thalers per
annum to relieve him of this part of his work. He had
to sign an agreement to lead a respectable and sober life;
to be faithful and diligent in the performance
of his duties; to have a proper respect
for the Council; not to make the church
music too long or too operatic; to instruct the boys in
instrumental as well as vocal music; to treat them with
humanity; not to send incapable singers to the New
Church;<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> not to make any journeys without permission
from the Burgomaster; and not to accept any office in
the University without leave from the Council.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p>

<p>After signing this agreement, he had to pass an examination
as to his religious views, and on the 13th
of May 1723, he was confirmed in the appointment:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
though the installation did not take place till the
31st.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 486px;">

<div class="caption"><div>St Thomas’ Church, Leipsic</div></div>
</div>

<p>Bach’s residence was in the left side of the school
buildings: but in 1731 the building was enlarged and
he for a year lived in a temporary residence, for which
the Council paid a rent of 60 thalers.</p>

<p>This particular post of cantor was one of the most important
in Germany and had been always held by a distinguished
man. The work was not heavy, though the
list of duties seems a long one; and he would have time
for his own engrossing occupation of composing. He
still held the rank of a capellmeister, and in addition
to that of Cöthen, he was given honorary rank as capellmeister
of the Court of Weissenfels in the year he removed
to Leipsic.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Troubles
with the
Authorities</i></div>

<p>And with the resumption of church work came difficulties
of many kinds. The authorities never, from first
to last, recognised that they had one of the
world’s greatest geniuses to deal with; in fact
they did not require a genius; all they asked
was that their cantor should be able to
carry out the church music in a respectable conventional
manner. Bach, with his lofty ideals, was so often at
variance with them that the history of his life at Leipsic
seems at first sight to consist of one long turmoil and
trouble.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cloud and Sunshine</div>

<p>Yet there are bright spots in the picture; and nothing
was able to disturb the equanimity with which, in spite of
external rubs, he for twenty-seven years continued to pour
forth his marvellous Passion music and cantatas.</p>

<p>It was very important from Bach’s point of view that
he should be in a position to control and regulate all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
church music that was performed at Leipsic; and for
this purpose he was obliged to take steps to obtain control
of the students’ chorus, which now sang in the University
Church. The organist there was Görner, a conceited and
not very competent musician, who had been in the habit of
directing the music after Kuhnau’s death.</p>

<p>Görner persuaded the authorities that the cantor
of St Thomas could not possibly serve St Paul’s<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> as
well as St Thomas and St Nicholas; and he therefore
continued in his post as musical director to the
University.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Appeal
to the King</i></div>

<p>The music for the University Festivals had, however,
been from time immemorial conducted by the cantor;
and Bach seems to have gained his way in the
matter. The cantor had a special payment for these
services; but Görner had appropriated part of it.
Bach tolerated this for two years, and then addressed
a letter to the King of Saxony explaining that he, by
right of office, conducted the music, but was
only paid half the official salary. The letter
was dated September 14, 1725, and on the
17th the Ministry of Dresden wrote to the University
requiring them to restore the salary to the petitioner,
or to show their reasons for not doing so.</p>

<p>The University wrote justifying themselves, whereupon
Bach, suspecting that they had not properly stated the
case, petitioned the King to allow him to see a copy of
their justification. He wrote a refutation of this, and<span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
the business dragged on till May 23, 1726, when a
document, which seems to have been in Bach’s favour,
was presented to the University, and the matter appears
to have ended. He and Görner were both employed to
compose the music for extra festivals, but Bach the more
often.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>Though Bach put all his energy into the music at the
two chief churches, he took care not to be merely a
cantor. He had formerly been, and still held honorary
rank as capellmeister; and having a very proper pride in
himself and his profession, he now always called himself
Director Musices and Cantor. Considerable importance
is attached in Germany to such titles as Professor,
Doctor, Capellmeister, Musicdirector, etc., which have
a recognised order of precedence; and it is significant of
the conditions that prevailed between Bach and his
church authorities that the latter nearly always persisted
in giving him the lower title of cantor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Matthew Passion’ Music</div>

<p>The first performance of the <i>Matthew Passion</i> music
took place in Holy Week of 1729. In his efforts to
improve the choir, he had asked the Council to allow
nine of the scholarships to be allotted to boys with
voices: and he hoped that the magnificent Passion
music he had just composed and performed would show
them the importance of providing better material;
but all was in vain. They took no notice of his request,
and showed a complete ignorance of the value of their
cantor’s work.</p>

<p>About this time he became conductor of the Musical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
Union, which had been founded by Telemann, but even
here troubles arose. The Union was expected to
strengthen the choir at St Thomas’ Church. No money,
however, being available to pay the students who took part,
they naturally fell off. Yet when the church music
deteriorated the Council were the first to blame the
cantor.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach is
admonished</i></div>

<p>They now began to observe, or imagine they observed,
neglect of duty on his part, and addressed various warnings
and admonitions to him. He became
defiant and refused to explain, whereupon
they said that he was incorrigible. The
chief trouble arose over the teaching of Latin. We have
already seen that the Council had originally offered to
pay a deputy to do this part of the cantor’s work, but
that Bach had undertaken the whole. Finding it too
irksome, however, he had himself paid Pezold to act as
his deputy, but the Council, considering Pezold incompetent,
wished to employ one Krügel. Instead of settling
the matter by insisting on Bach’s doing the work himself,
they showed their petulance by bringing charges against
him of not having behaved with propriety, of sending a
member of the choir into the country without giving
notice to the authorities, of going a journey without
permission, of neglecting his singing classes, and, in
short, of doing nothing properly. At first it was proposed
to put him down to one of the lowest classes, next to
refuse payment of his salary, and at the same time to
admonish him. His doing “nothing” consisted in composing
and conducting an enormous number of church
cantatas, including the <i>Matthew Passion</i>.</p>

<p>But the Council merely required hack work of him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
and no doubt as they paid him to do hack work
(which could probably have been equally well done
by an inferior musician) they had a right to demand
it.</p>

<p>He had, it is true, given over half the singing practices
to the choir prefect, but this was only in accordance with
long established custom, and no one had previously complained.
Moreover the Council themselves had refused
Bach’s request for a more efficient choir, and it was
only natural that he should not take much interest in
the drudgery of teaching an unruly rabble, when he
was occupied with work which was to prove so much
more important to the world at large.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Vestry Squabbles</div>

<p>In the constant state of conflict between masters, boys,
Council and Consistory, Bach chose to go his own way.
With the Rector, Ernesti, who troubled himself little
about the musical arrangements, he had been on excellent
terms.</p>

<p>Several stories are told of the petty tyranny sought to
be exercised over the great man by an ignorant and fussy
vestry. Thus, Bach insisted, for sufficient reasons, on
his right of choosing the hymns and ignoring those
selected by Gaudlitz, the subdean of St Nicholas. Gaudlitz
reported him to the Consistory, who sent him a notice
that he must have the hymns sung which were chosen by
the preacher. He therefore appealed to the Council,
showing that it had been the custom for the cantor to
select the hymns. This caused a squabble between the
Council and the Consistory, but it is not known how the
matter ended.</p>

<p>Another instance occurred over the announcement of
the performance of a <i>Passion</i> music, for which the Council<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
suddenly discovered that their permission was necessary.
The work had been performed several times previously,
and the irritating restriction was entirely uncalled for.
Bach simply reported to the superintendent of the Consistory
that the Council had forbidden the performance;
and thus produced another quarrel between the two
bodies which was to his advantage.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Inefficiency
of Musicians</i></div>

<p>Bach had not only to organise and train his choir, but to
teach some of his pupils to play on instruments, since the
town musicians were only seven in number,
four wind and three string players. Money
was not forthcoming to pay professional
musicians, though there were plenty in Leipsic. Bach
therefore got hold of the more gifted of his pupils and
taught them instruments, and many of them became
accomplished artists.</p>

<p>The regulations ordered that two hours of singing
practice should be held on Mondays, Tuesdays and
Wednesdays, from 12 to 2; but as this arrangement
interfered with the cantor’s dinner hour, his colleagues
petitioned that it should be changed. The Council
refused to alter the regulation, and in consequence Bach
soon began to absent himself.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Confiscation
of Fees</i></div>

<p>As the Council could not withhold his salary, they
not only confiscated certain fees collected for various
outside duties but also contrived that he
should obtain no benefit from a legacy left to
be divided among the teachers and poorer
scholars of the School. Bach was silent for a time, but,
when at last forced to speak, he wrote a long letter,
showing how absolutely inadequate were the means placed
at his disposal: incompetent town players, with mere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
boys to complete the bands; singers who, not having
had time to be trained, were obliged to be admitted to
the vacant places before they had any knowledge of music;
choirs with only two voices to a part, one of whom would
often be, or pretend to be, ill.</p>

<p>Bach’s letter irritated the Council, who, however, let
the matter drop after expressing their opinion on it.</p>

<p>The Council acted according to their lights. Though
they would not give Bach the means he required for
carrying out the music properly, they could understand
when an organ required repairing, and voted sums of
money from time to time for this purpose, and for the
purchase of violins, violas, violoncellos for church use;
and they allowed Bach to purchase Bodenschatz’s <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Florilegium
Portense</span><a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> for the use of the scholars. They did
not actively hinder Bach’s development, but they had no
conception of the greatness of the man they had to do
with. They curtailed his income in a moment of anger,
but soon afterwards reinstated it.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach tries to leave Leipsic</i></div>

<p>Bach became thoroughly hurt, and sought for a means
of leaving Leipsic. The friend of his boyhood, Erdmann,
now held a post at Dantzic, under the Emperor of Russia,
and to him Bach applied, in an interesting
letter which is still extant.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> He describes
his wish to leave Leipsic under four heads:
(1) that the post was by no means so advantageous
as he was led to expect; (2) that many of the fees had
been stopped; (3) that the place is very dear to live in;
(4) that the authorities were strange people, with small
love of music, who vexed and persecuted and were jealous
of him. Bach asked Erdmann to find him a post at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Dantzic, but nothing came of it, for he remained at
Leipsic. In spite of the high prices of necessities, he
saved enough to leave behind him a well-furnished house,
a sum of money and a collection of instruments and books.
Like many other good organists he had his rubs with an
unthinking vestry, but got over them.</p>

<p>The Rector, Ernesti, died in 1729, and in 1730 Bach’s
Weimar friend, Gesner, was appointed: a member of the
Council saying that he “hoped that they would fare better
in this appointment than they had done in that of the
cantor.”<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>The new rector was in most respects the opposite of
Ernesti. He was energetic; had the power of governing,
with a special talent for the management of schoolboys.
He was a brilliant scholar, and did much to revive the
study of Greek as part of a mental and moral training
rather than as a mere intellectual gymnastic.</p>

<p>The Council were delighted, and did everything for
him. As he was in delicate health they not only had
him carried to and from the school in a chair, but remitted
his duty of inspecting the school once every
three weeks. He smoothed over the disputes among
the masters so that they were no longer at enmity
among themselves; won the affection of his pupils by
his new methods of instruction, his interest in their
welfare, and the enforcement of discipline and morality.</p>

<p>The State, he said, had need of every kind of talent:
and if he saw boys working at something useful, which was
not actually school work, he would encourage them. He
also revived the Latin prayers morning and evening, which
had been replaced by prayers in the German language.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>Between him and Bach there grew up a strong friendship.
He helped the music in every way he could:
himself applying to the Council for the books, etc., required
by Bach.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Gesner’s
Appreciation</i></div>

<div>Gesner, in his appreciation of Bach, appends a note
in his edition of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Institutiones Oratoriæ</span> of Quintilianus,
to the author’s remark on the capacity
of man for doing several things at once, such
as playing the lyre, and at the same time
singing and marking time with the foot. He says, “All
this, my dear Fabius, you would consider very trivial could
you but rise from the dead and hear Bach: how he, with
both hands, and using all his fingers, either on a keyboard
which seems to consist of many lyres in one, or on the
<div class="sidenote">A Vast Combination</div>
instrument of instruments, of which the innumerable pipes
are made to sound by means of bellows; here with his hands,
and there with the utmost celerity with his feet, elicits
many of the most various yet harmonious sounds: I say,
could you only see him, how he achieves what a number
of your lyre-players and six hundred flute-players could
never achieve, presiding over thirty or forty performers all
at once, recalling this one by a nod, another by a stamp
of the foot, another with a warning finger, keeping tune
and time; and while high notes are given out by some,
deep tones by others, and notes between them by others.
Great admirer as I am of antiquity in other respects, yet I
am of the opinion that my one Bach, and whosoever there
may chance to be that resembles him, unites in himself
many Orpheuses, and twenty Arions.”<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></div>

<p>Gesner did all he could to smooth away Bach’s troubles,
and probably the latter was much happier than under the
disorder which prevailed while J. H. Ernesti was rector.
Moreover, after one more dispute, Bach and the Council
at last learned to understand one another, and quarrelled
no more.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Home Life</i></div>

<p>Let us now turn for a moment from this account of
troubles and see what the man was like in his own
home. We have fairly full accounts from which to
draw a picture. It was related in chapter i. how the
various members of the Bach family clung together,
meeting once every year at various towns. The same
traits are found in the household. The pupils and
sons all loved him. His character was amiable in the
extreme, but at the same time such as to command
respect from all. Of his hospitality, especially towards
artists, we have special mention; no musician passed
through Leipsic without visiting him. He never cared
either himself to blame, or hear others find fault with,
his fellow-musicians. Of the Marchand incident he
would never willingly speak. He was modest in the
extreme, and never seemed to know how much greater
he was than all the musicians he was fond of praising.</p>

<p>In the midst of all his occupations he found time for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
music in the family circle, and in later years he used to
prefer playing the viola, as he was then “in the midst of
the harmony.” He would occasionally extemporise
a trio or quartet on the harpsichord
from a single part of some other composer’s music: if the
composer happened to be present, however, he would first
make sure that no possible injury would be done to his
feelings.</p>

<p>Though kindly and generous in his criticisms of others,
he would never tolerate superficiality and incompetence.
He was therefore looked upon as an excellent examiner
when a new organist was to be appointed to a church.
He was quick-tempered, like most musicians in matters
of music. It is related that on one occasion, when the
organist of the Thomas Church, Görner, made a blunder, he
pulled the wig off his own head, threw it at Görner, and, in a
voice of thunder, cried: “You ought to be a shoemaker.”</p>

<p>His favourite instrument was the clavichord, on account
of its power of expression: and he made his pupils chiefly
practise on this. He learned to tune it and the harpsichord
so quickly that it never took him more than a
quarter of an hour. “And then,” says Forkel, “all the
twenty-four keys were at his service: he did with them
whatever he wished. He could connect the most distant
keys as easily and naturally together as the nearest related,
so that the listener thought he had only modulated
through the next-related keys of a single scale. Of harshness
in modulation he knew nothing: his chromatic
changes were as soft and flowing as when he kept to
the diatonic genus.”</p>

<p>Of his conscientiousness in examining organs and
organists, Forkel ironically remarks, it was such that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
he gained few friends thereby. But when he found
that an organ-builder had really done good work, and
was out of pocket by so doing, he would use his influence
to obtain further payment for the man, and in
several cases succeeded.</p>

<p>If he happened to be away from home with his son
Friedemann on a Sunday, he would make a point of
attending the church service. He would criticise the
organist; would tell his son what course the fugue ought
to take (after hearing the subject), and would be delighted
if the organist played to his satisfaction.</p>

<p>He did his best for his sons and pupils; in fact he
treated the latter as sons. He sent his two eldest sons to
the University of Leipsic, and used his influence to get
appointments for them and their brothers. On the marriage
of his daughter Elizabeth with his pupil Altnikol, he
obtained an organistship for him at Naumburg without
informing him beforehand.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Of Many Parts</div>

<p>Though he would have nothing to say to musical mathematics,
his knowledge of everything to do with the art and
practice of music was astounding. He was intimate with
every detail of organ construction; he not only tuned but
quilled his own harpsichords, and, as we shall see later,
he invented new instruments. When he was shown the
newly built opera house at Berlin, he observed the construction
of the dining saloon, and said that if a person
whispered in a corner, another person, standing in the
corner diagonally opposite would hear every word, though
no one else could do so. Experiment proved this to be
a fact, though neither the architect nor anyone else had
discovered it.</p>

<p>An amusing story is told of a visit paid to him at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
Leipsic by one Hurlebusch, a superficial and exceedingly
conceited organist. Hurlebusch had the reputation of
being angry if his listeners praised him instead of being
so overcome with his playing that they could say nothing.
His visit to Bach was made, not to hear but to be heard
by, and to astonish, the great man. Bach took him to
the harpsichord and listened attentively to a very feeble
minuet with variations. Hurlebusch, taking Bach’s
politeness as a recognition of his great talent, showed
his gratitude by presenting Friedemann with a printed
collection of very easy sonatas, recommending him to
practise them diligently. His host, who could hardly
repress a smile, thanked him politely, and took leave of
him without in the least betraying his amusement.</p>

<p>When we think that the education of his large family,
the hospitality to strangers, the journeys to try organs in
various places, were all accomplished on an income of not
much over £100 a year, we must admire the business-like
capacity of the man, even though all due allowance
is made for the difference in the purchasing power of
money in those days.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> But he managed to collect a by
no means contemptible library of music and theological
books; for in his simple piety he took great interest
in religious questions. He also possessed a goodly
number of keyboard instruments, several of which he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
gave to his sons on their obtaining appointments. Of
stringed instruments he possessed enough for the performance
of concerted music in the home circle. Some
few of his personal belongings are preserved in the
De Wit collection at Leipsic, not twenty yards from his
residence. They consist of his clock, a few pictures and
trifles belonging to his study table, and show at once that
they come from a house of refinement and comfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Preference
of a Simple
Home Life
to Riches</i></div>

<p>In later life he heard and studied with great pleasure
the works of Fux, Handel, Caldara, Keiser, Hasse, the
two Grauns, Telemann, Zelenka, Bendax, and others. He
knew most of these personally, and received Hasse and
his wife Faustina as visitors at Leipsic. He often went to
Dresden from Leipsic to hear the opera there, and used to
say to his son “Friedemann, shall we not go and hear
the pretty little Dresden songs again?” He was, says
Forkel, far too deeply interested in his art and
his home life to enrich himself by travelling
and exhibiting his powers, though he might,
especially at the time in which he lived, have
easily become wealthy by so doing. He preferred
the quiet homely life, and the unbroken work at
his art, and was contented with his lot. The “glory of
God,” not fame, was his object. But though his home
life and his work were a source of so much happiness, the
external horizon began to be stormy again.</p>

<div class="sidenote">More Storm</div>

<p>Gesner resigned his post in 1734, and was succeeded
by the Conrector, Joh. August Ernesti, a young and
learned man, who, however, had no sympathy with music.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a>
He was at first on excellent terms with the cantor, and
was godfather to two of his sons; but, unfortunately, his
want of appreciation of music led, within a short time, to
trouble. Poor Bach seems at Leipsic to have been rarely
free from disputes and worries. It is true he was proud,
sensitive, and irritable, where the dignity of his art or his
own personal rights were concerned; but that the fault
was not all on his side is shown by his friendly relations
with the Dukes of Weimar and Cöthen, and with all true
artists. His reputation throughout Germany was by this
time enormous; and in Leipsic itself he was considered
by all except the Council and Consistory, as the “glory
of the town.” It is true his compositions were heard with
more respect than appreciation; but his fame as an organist,
harpsichord player, and learned musician was recognised
at Leipsic as elsewhere.</p>

<div class="sidenote">War with Rector</div>

<div>The trouble with Ernesti was not of an uncommon
nature; where there is a want of appreciation of music on
the part of learned men, there is very apt to be jealousy
of the reputation and influence of its professors. Disputes
arising from this cause seem to have been not at all rare
in Germany at the time. Ernesti hated music, and was
undignified enough to make sarcastic remarks to any boy
whom he happened to see practising an instrument. He
endeavoured, being young and active, to intermeddle in
the musical arrangements, with serious results. There is
preserved in the “Acta” of the Town Council, a “Complaint”
by Bach, dated August 12, 1736, to the effect
that the Rector Ernesti had exceeded his powers by
promoting the prefect of the second choir to be prefect
of the first. This may appear at first sight an unimportant
matter; but, as Bach points out, the prefect of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
first choir must not only be chosen on account of his
voice and character, but he must also have
the ability and knowledge to conduct the
music when the cantor is not able to be
present. It stands to reason, therefore, that
the cantor is the only person who can make the
selection. On the following day Bach addressed another
letter to the Council saying that Ernesti had threatened to
reduce and flog any boys who obeyed the cantor’s directions;
that he (Bach) had not allowed the “incompetent
Krause” (the prefect chosen by Ernesti) to conduct the
<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Appointment
of a Choir
Prefect</i></div>
motet at St Nicolai, but had requested a student, Krebs,
to do so; that the boys were afraid to obey Bach in consequence
of the rector’s threats; and that his authority,
which was necessary for the proper performance of the
music, would be destroyed if this kind of thing were
allowed to go on. The quarrel continued; Bach wrote
two more letters, and, since the Council would not move,
he appealed to the Court at Dresden. Ernesti also wrote
stating his side of the question. This Krause was a
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mauvais sujet</i>, was deeply in debt, and had a bad character,
and the rector wished to give him a chance of recovering
his character before leaving school. In order to
settle the matter, the Council finally ordained that as it was
Krause’s last term he was to remain prefect to the end of it.</div>

<p>Bitter says that the fault lay as usual on both sides:
but with this we cannot agree. Bach was a man nearly
twice as old and experienced as the rector; and he
was undoubtedly within his rights in insisting on choosing
those responsible for carrying out the music. On
this occasion Ernesti said he was “too proud to conduct
a simple chorale.”</p>

<p>At the end of 1736 Bach went to Dresden where he
was given the title of composer to the Saxon Court.
He had applied for a title three years before, in the
hope that it would place him in a better position with
regard to the Council and Consistory; but it was in
vain that he hoped for this. Neither his works nor his
titles were able to impress them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>An Adverse
Criticism</i></div>

<p>We learn from a Dresden newspaper of that date
that he played from two to four in the afternoon of
December 1st on the new organ in the church of St
Paul, in the presence of the Russian Ambassador, von
Kayserling, and many artists and other persons who heard
him with very great admiration. In the same year, 1736,
was published a book of hymns with their melodies by
Schemelli, as a second volume to the book of Freylingshausen,
to which Bach had in his early days contributed
some of the music. On the 14th of May, 1737,
there appeared a severe criticism of the way in which
Bach wrote out all his <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">manieren</i> or grace notes, instead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
of leaving them for the performer to add at his discretion.
The music thereby loses all its charm of harmony,
says the critic, and the melody becomes
incomprehensible. He wonders that a man
should give himself so much trouble to act against reason.
The writer was J. A. Scheibe, a young man who had failed
in a competition for an organistship in which Bach was one
of the examiners. The attack was answered by Birnbaum, a
friend of Bach’s, in an interesting critical analysis of Bach’s
works. This was answered by Scheibe, and the dispute went
on for some time, other writers joining in it, until, as Bitter
remarks, “all their powder was exhausted.” Bach, however,
worked away without troubling himself about the matter.</p>

<p>In 1738 Mizler,<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> a pupil of Bach’s, founded a society
for raising the status of music. Though it was successful,
the great musician was not induced to join it until 1747,
nine years later, when he handed into the society a triple
canon in six voices on the chorale “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vom Himmel hoch,
da komm’ ich her</span>” as an “exercise.” It is to Mizler’s
society that we owe the preservation of the portrait by
Hausmann, now in the Thomas-schule, which is reproduced
in this work: and still further have we to thank it for the
account of his life, on which all later biographies are based.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Disputes</div>

<div>Spitta gives accounts of further disputes. On one
occasion a prefect having punished some small boys at
Bach’s special order, the rector ordered him to be publicly
flogged, whereupon the prefect immediately left the
school rather than suffer such indignity. A boy happening
to pitch a hymn at St Nicholas too low for the congregation
to sing, Bach was summoned before the Council and told to
see that it did not happen again. The rector threatened to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
confiscate the boys’ money if they obeyed the cantor
and accused Bach of being accessible to bribery. In
<div class="sidenote"><i>A Successor
Chosen</i></div>
the <i>Leipsic Chronicle</i> for 1749 we read that on June 8th
Gottlob Harrer was chosen as the future cantor
of St Thomas, “when Capellmeister and
Cantor Herr Sebastian Bach should die.” The
text of the cantata performed before the Council on this
occasion was “The rich man died and was buried.” The
Council seemed indeed anxious to get rid of the great man
who had done more than all others to make their city famous.</div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Visit to
Frederick
the Great</i></div>


<div>There is little more to relate. Bach from time to time
made his journeys to various towns, and paid visits to
Erfurt, where his cousin, Joh. Christoph, and Adlung
were settled. As he advanced in years he gave up these
journeys. The last he made was to the Court of Frederick
the Great at Potsdam in 1747. His son
Emanuel had been capellmeister to Frederick
since 1740; and the king had frequently, and
always with more insistence, thrown out hints
that he would like to hear the great artist. Bach being
much occupied, and disinclined for travelling, did not accede
to the king’s wishes until they amounted to a positive
command. Then, taking Friedemann with him, he started for
Potsdam, which he reached early in May. The story of the
meeting with Frederick is variously told. We will tell it in
Friedemann’s own words: “When Frederick II. had just
prepared his flute, in the presence of the whole orchestra,
for the evening’s concert, the list of strangers who had
arrived was brought him. Holding his flute in his hand
he glanced through the list. Then he turned round with
excitement to the assembled musicians, and, laying down
his flute, said, ‘Gentlemen, old Bach is come.’ Bach,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
who was at his son’s house, was immediately invited to
the castle. He had not even time allowed him to take
off his travelling clothes and put on his black Court-dress.
He appeared, with many apologies for the state of his dress,
before the great prince, who received him with marked attention,
and threw a deprecating look towards the Court gentlemen,
who were laughing at the discomposure and numerous
compliments of the old man. The flute concerto was given
up for this evening; and the king led his famous visitor into
all the rooms of the castle, and begged him to try the
Silbermann pianos, which he (the king) thought very highly
of, and of which he possessed seven.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The musicians
accompanied the king and Bach from one room to
another; and after the latter had tried all the pianos, he
begged the king to give him a fugue subject, that he
could at once extemporise upon. Frederick thereupon
wrote out the subject (afterwards used in the musical
offering), and Bach developed this in the most learned
and interesting manner, to the great astonishment of the
king, who, on his side, asked to hear a fugue in six parts.
But, since every subject is not adapted for so full a
working out, Bach chose one for himself, and astounded
those present by his performance.
<div class="sidenote">‘Only One Bach’</div>
The king, who was
not easily astonished, was completely taken by surprise at
the unapproachable mastery of the old cantor. Several
times he cried ‘There is only one Bach.’ On the follow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>ing
day he played on all the organs in the churches of
Potsdam, and again in the evening on the Silbermann
pianos. From here he paid a visit to Berlin, where he
was shown the opera house.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></div>

<p>A newspaper account of the visit to Frederick
varies in several details from the above; but as the
account of the son, who was with Bach, and perhaps
an eye-witness, is the more trustworthy, we have not
thought it necessary to trouble our reader with the
second account.<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Last Illness</i></div>

<p>In the following year the enormous strain he had all his
life put upon himself began to take its effect. Although of
unusual strength, the work had worn out his
body. First his eyes, which had been used
day and night from the time he copied his brother’s book
by moonlight, began to give way. The weakness gradually
increased, and pains began to trouble him, yet he could
not believe that he was near his end. Friends persuaded
him to undergo an operation at the hands of an eminent
English oculist, who was then in Leipsic. But the result
of two operations was that he lost his sight altogether, and
his health was so broken down by them that he never again
left his house, while he was in constant pain till his death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Death</div>

<p>But he continued to work, even through his hours of
greatest suffering. He set the chorale “When we are
in the greatest need” in four parts, dictating them to
Altnikol, his son-in-law. An extraordinary thing happened
ten days before his death; one morning he was able
to see well and to bear daylight; but a few hours after an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
apoplectic stroke, followed by a violent fever, completely
overcame him. The attentions of the two best doctors
in Leipsic could not avail against the illness, and at a
quarter past eight o’clock in the evening of July 28, 1750,
he breathed his last.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px;">
<a href="images/illot088bh.jpg">
<img src="images/illot088bs.jpg" class="picture" width="494" height="500" alt="" /></a>
<div class="caption"><div>St John’s Church, Leipsic</div></div>
</div>

<p>He was buried in St John’s churchyard, and, like that
of Mozart, his grave was forgotten and lost. The churchyard
was altered early in the nineteenth century, to allow
of a new road being made, and his bones with those of
many others were removed. Some remains lately discovered
on the south side of the church are supposed
with good reason to be those of Bach; but nothing is
known for certain.</p>

<p>On his deathbed he had dictated to Altnikol the
chorale “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vor deinen Thron tret ich hiemit</span>.” The
<i>Leipsic Chronicle</i> notices his death as follows: “July 28,
at eight in the evening the famous and learned musician
Herr Joh. Sebastian Bach, composer to His Majesty the
King of Poland and Elector of Saxony; Capellmeister to the
Courts of Cöthen and Weissenfels, Director and Cantor
of the school of St Thomas, died.” Here follows a
sketch of his life. “The Bach family came from Hungary,
and all, as far as is known, have been musicians, from
which perhaps arises the fact that even the letters b, a, c, h,
form a melodic succession of notes.”<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>That is all; not one word of regret. Nor do we find
that much notice anywhere was taken of the death of the
great man. A meeting of the Council took place shortly
afterwards in which, while no expressions of sympathy
were heard, the remark was made, “Herr Bach was a
great musician no doubt, but we want a schoolmaster,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
not a capellmeister”; and they proceeded at once to
arrange for the instalment of Harrer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fate of the
Widow and
Children</i></div>

<p>The sons of the first marriage took possession of all
music that was of value, and sold the rest of the property.
Görner, Bach’s former rival, undertook the duties of
guardian to his younger children, and seems
to have fulfilled the task with propriety and
reverence. Bach’s widow was allowed her
husband’s salary for six months, after which,
receiving no help from her stepsons, she supported her
younger children as well as she could, and becoming
gradually poorer, died in an almshouse and was buried
in a pauper’s grave. The youngest daughter, Regina, lived
till 1809, and was supported by charity in her old age.</p>

<p>The family of Joh. Sebastian Bach gradually died out,
and is now extinct, the last representative, a farmer of
Eisenach, having died in 1846.</p>

<p>Bach’s music fell more and more into oblivion, and for
a time his name seems to have been forgotten. In 1883
a room in the Thomas-schule was used as the English
Church, and on the first floor a smaller room was used
as the vestry. In the latter was a cupboard in which the
communion plate and surplices were kept. The writer
was told that this cupboard had formerly been full of
music MSS., and that during the years of oblivion, whenever
a Thomas-schule boy wanted a piece of paper to
wrap up his “Butterbrod” he was allowed to tear out a
sheet of paper from one of Bach’s manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>Thus after his death were treated the family and works
of the man “to whom music owes as much as religion
does to its founder.”</p>

<h2>Chapter VIII</h2>


<p class="center">The Cantatas and the Chorale</p>



<div class="sidenote"><i>Characteristics
of
Bach’s
Music</i></div>

<p>The prevailing characteristics in Bach’s compositions are
intense earnestness of purpose, and, in his church music,
a deep religious feeling, too deep for the
ordinary everyday person to appreciate; an
absolute absence of anything extraneous, such
as concessions to singers and performers, or to
the fashion of the day. When Bach writes
florid or highly ornamental passages, they are not intended
merely to exhibit the skill of the performer&mdash;their most
important purpose is the exact expression of the words or
emotions in hand. In this he and Beethoven were at
one. Their difficulties of execution arise from the necessities
of artistic expression, and such difficulties will be
found in all the truest and best art, the art that lives
beyond the fashion of the hour.</p>

<p>Bach, like Beethoven, suffered from the influx of a
superficial kind of music which so easily captivates an
unthinking public.</p>

<p>The proximity of the Dresden Court, with its Italian
Opera Company and the opening of an opera-house in
Leipsic itself, had much the same effect in attracting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Leipsic public away from the solidity and severity of the
cantor (whom, all the same, they never ceased to respect)
as the Rossini fever had in the beginning of the nineteenth
century at Vienna with regard to Beethoven’s
music. Bach, however, was in a worse position than
Beethoven, for he lived and worked in a small circle of
German towns, and only in the domain of church music.
Teutonic to the backbone, he expressed his thoughts in
his own way without swerving to the right or left. He
never had occasion to try and please any but a North
German public, and he mostly endeavoured only to
please himself, and promote the “glory of God” in his
own way, by adhering strictly to what his genius told
him was right; and posterity has endorsed his views.</p>

<p>Beethoven, on the other hand, lived at a time when
communications between countries were beginning to be
more rapid and frequent. The French Revolution, and
the constant wars brought about by the ambition of
Napoleon, though temporarily hostile to the actual
practice of art, had the effect of making whatever art
was produced more cosmopolitan, and therefore more
easily appreciated outside the artist’s country. Thus
Beethoven’s music soon became known in England:
and at the very time when the Rossini fever was causing
him to be forgotten in Vienna (the town of his adoption)
the English Philharmonic Society was negotiating
with the great composer for the composition of a
symphony, and these negotiations, as is well known,
resulted in the production of the greatest symphony the
world has yet seen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach and
Handel</i></div>

<p>It is customary to compare the two musical giants of
the first half of the eighteenth century, Handel and Bach.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Both were born in the same year, 1685, Handel being the
senior by one month only: both were natives of small
German towns, within a few miles of each
other. Both received their earliest musical
education in Germany, but with the difference
that Bach, coming of a family of professional musicians,
there was never any thought of bringing him up to any
other profession, while Handel’s father, a surgeon, had all
the prejudices of his time and profession against music,
and did his best to stifle his son’s proclivities, till they
became too strong for him to longer withstand.</p>

<p>After early childhood the ways of the composers were
widely different. While Bach was painfully acquiring
the technique of his art, by making long journeys
on foot to hear and get instruction from eminent
German organists, by practising assiduously day and
night, and by copying all the best music he could lay
hands on, Handel was playing the violin and harpsichord
in the German opera conducted by Keiser at
Hamburg.</p>

<p>At the age of twenty-one Handel went to Italy and
remained there three years studying, and successfully composing
operas for the Italians, who called him “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Il caro
Sassone</span>,”&mdash;“the dear Saxon.” At twenty-one Bach was
organist of a small and unimportant German town,
still working hard to improve his technical powers in
every direction. Everyone knows that Handel made
his first reputation as a composer of Italian operas
which are completely forgotten, and not till he was fifty-five
years old did he begin that series of oratorios or
sacred dramas by which he is immortalised. Bach, on
the other hand, making the organ and the chorale his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
starting point, continued all his life to compose sacred
music&mdash;“church music” as it was called, and never wrote
for the theatre. Handel, domiciled in England, knew his
public and knew them so well that he wrote works which
not only became popular at once, but have never ceased
to be popular. Bach either did not know, or did not
care to please his public, and wrote far above their
heads, so that for a time after his death he was forgotten
entirely: only when Mozart, and afterwards
Mendelssohn, became acquainted with the wonders of
his genius did the public, almost against their will, begin
to appreciate what a giant had been on the earth in
those days.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Ein feste
Burg</i></div>

<p>Bach’s place in Lutheran Church history is very
important. He is connected directly with the Reformation
through the chorale, which Luther so much
encouraged as a means of spreading the new views of
religion. Bach was a strict Lutheran; and the chorale,
or hymn to be sung by the congregation, was perhaps the
most important expression of Lutheran religious feeling.
The words will explain this perhaps better than anything
else, if we take an example at random from the Leipziger
Gesangbuch, in literal prose translation&mdash;<i>e.g.</i>
No. 171: “A strong castle is our God; a
good defence and weapon; he freely helps
us in all trouble that can meet us. The ancient wicked
enemy is in earnest; his cruel armour is great power and
much deceit: there is none like him on the earth.</p>

<p>“We can do nothing of our own power, we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
soon lost: but there fights for us the right man,
whom God himself has chosen. Dost thou ask
his name? Jesus Christ is his name, the Lord of
Sabaoth. There is no other God; he is bound to win
the day.</p>

<p>“And if the world were full of devils, who would
devour us, we need not fear much, for we shall conquer.
The prince of this world, however sour he may
appear, can do nothing against us: a word is able to
slay him,” &amp;c.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Notable Chorale</div>

<p>This is one of the chorales assigned to the Festival
of the Reformation, and one can imagine with what force
it would appeal to those disposed towards Luther’s
teaching. Its well-known melody was composed by
Luther, and it was used by Bach as the foundation
of a cantata which is considered by Zelter to have
been composed in celebration of the 200th anniversary
of the Reformation in 1717, but the composer
re-arranged it in 1730. The orchestra contains
three trumpets, one flute, two oboes, one oboe di
caccia, two violins, viola, violoncello, organ and figured
bass.</p>

<p>The first chorus set to the words of the first verse has
the following vigorous opening, the orchestra playing
an independent accompaniment. (For convenience of
English readers we quote from Novello’s octavo
edition.)</p>

<p>This is worked in bold fugato (both chorus and orchestra
taking the subject or the counter-subject), for thirty-six
bars, which are then repeated, note for note, to the words:
“In need His help our freedom gains, o’er all we fear prevailing.”</p>

<p>A short quotation may serve to give some idea of the
fulness of the writing and the boldness of the counterpoint,
of which the effect, when sung with proper energy,
is overwhelming.</p>

<p>&amp;c.
treated fugato for twenty bars; and each line is worked
in the same way.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Massive Chorus</div>

<p>The whole chorus is 221 bars in length, and is a
masterpiece of massive choral and orchestral writing, in
keeping with the sentiment of the words. It opens with
three trumpets, drums, violoncello, and organ manual, the
pedal being silent for the first twenty-three bars. At the
twenty-fourth bar (the first quoted on page 97) the pedal
enters with the 16 feet Posaune, and makes a bold canon of
eight bars, with the melody played in the highest register
of the trumpet. The canon concludes with a drum passage
on the dominant; and fresh canons between trumpet and
pedal occur at bars 49, 88, 122, 147, 178 and 200.</p>

<p>These seven canons are all formed on the musical phrases
of the tune: and one might almost look upon the chorus
as a gigantic “choral-vorspiel” with long vocal and instrumental
interludes between the phrases given out by the
trumpets and pedal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A Florid Duet</div>

<p>The second verse is set as a duet for treble and bass,
still in the key of D. After a ritornello, the bass enters
with the words “all men born of God our Father, at the
last will Jesus gather,” set to exceedingly florid passages,
above which floats the melody in the treble voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>A bass recitative, commenting on the preceding sentiments
follows, and then a treble aria, “Within my heart
of hearts, Lord Jesus, make thy dwelling.” In the fifth
number the whole chorus sings the melody in unison, now
changed to 6/8 time, and with a very florid accompaniment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 415px;">
<img src="images/illot100.png" width="415" height="100" alt="If all the world with fiends were filled." />
</div>


<p>This is followed by a tenor recitative, “Then close
beside Thy Saviour’s blood-besprinkled banner, my soul
remain,” &amp;c., a duet for alto and tenor, “How blessed
then are they, who still on God are calling;” and the
cantata concludes with the chorale simply harmonised in
four parts, “That word shall still in strength abide,” in
the form familiar to English congregations.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Fertility of
Invention</i></div>

<p>We have given a fairly full description of this fine
cantata in order to show our readers what is meant when
it is said that Bach based his church music essentially on
chorale. Most of the cantatas are constructed in the
same kind of way, <i>i.e.</i> a chorale is used as the chief
subject. But that Bach did not merely
work on a fixed model is shown by the fact
that no two of the one hundred and ninety
cantatas published by the Bachgesellschaft are alike.
Nothing astonishes us more than the enormous fertility
of invention shown in these wonderful works, the
variety of detail, and yet the unity of purpose. The one
idea of the composer was the religious effect to be
obtained by the highest efforts of art devoted to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
service of God. Except in Germany, they are rarely
heard in their proper place as part of the church service:
but the mere reading through of the scores produces a
most profound effect, and creates a perpetual astonishment
in the reader at the enormous resources of the composer.</p>

<p>Bach is generally considered as the greatest composer
for the organ, but his organ works, wonderful as they
are, seem small in comparison with these marvellous
cantatas, all different and yet all connected, as it were,
by an underlying unity of purpose.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Choral-vorspiel</i></div>

<p>Bach took the melody of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein feste Burg</span>” for one of
his finest choral-vorspiele (Peters, 245, No. 22). This
is a particularly interesting composition, since
it is the only chorale in which we obtain any
clue to Bach’s methods of registering. In
Walther’s MS. are given a few indications “a 3 clav.” for
three manuals. The left hand is to begin with the fagott,
sixteen feet, and the right hand on the choir with the
“sesquialtera.” The piece was doubtless intended for the
organ at Mühlhausen which was renovated and enlarged
under Bach’s directions, and which had three manuals, containing
on one a sixteen feet “fagott,” and on another a
combination producing a “good sesquialtera tone.” It is
one of the larger choral-vorspiele, containing fifty-eight bars.</p>

<p>It is worth while noticing how Bach, in this, and all
other choral-vorspiele, does not adhere literally to the notes
of the melody, but introduces ornamental passages, or
lengthens and shortens notes to serve his purpose, or introduces
the subject in augmentation and diminution.
This was the regular custom amongst German organists.
The choral-vorspiel is, in its simplest form, merely intended
to prepare the congregation for the melody that is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
to be sung, but instead of a mere bald playing through
of the tune, as is usual in English churches, the organist
was expected to use his art in elaborating it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">‘Surprising Variations’</div>

<p>Bach, in his younger days, was accused of over-elaborating,
not only the vorspiele, but the accompaniment. It
was a fault of youth, and hardly called for the official
censure that the Council at Arnstadt thought fit to administer.
He was practically his own teacher. If he
had been under the guidance of an older and more experienced
organist, he would undoubtedly have curbed
his zeal for “surprising variations.”</p>

<p>At that time he seems to have lost sight of the fact that he
was expected to accompany the congregation. He forgot
all about them, and gave free rein to his imagination so
that the “congregation were confounded.” And well they
might be, by the following example of his accompaniment.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<p>He was in reality not suited to be a mere accompanist&mdash;his
genius was too great to be tied down to the formal
notes sung by the congregation, and a far lesser man
would have suited this kind of work better. His choral-vorspiele
are masterpieces of organ work; his extemporised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
or written accompaniments are artistic, but quite impracticable.</p>

<p>But when he harmonises a chorale in vocal parts for
his choir to sing with the congregation, his genius shines
forth in the most exquisite harmonic combinations possible.
Examples abound, and a volume might be written
on this subject alone. We can only indicate here a few
instances of various treatments of the chorale.</p>

<p>Every one knows the opening double chorus in the
<i>Matthew Passion</i>. After an instrumental introduction full
of dignity and solemnity, built chiefly on tonic and dominant
pedals (E minor), the first chorus sings, “Come ye
daughters, weep with me, behold the Lamb as a bridegroom.”
The second chorus exclaims, “Whom? How?”
while the first continues its course, and a “Soprano
ripieno” chorus enters with the chorale&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">

<img src="images/illot104.png" width="500" height="149" alt="" />


<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">O thou begotten son of God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who on the cross wast slain.<br /></span>
</div></div></div>



<p>The work is now performed every Good Friday in the
Thomas Church at Leipsic. The organ gallery occupies
the whole of the west end of the nave and two side aisles.
On each side are placed the singers, the soprano and
alto parts being sung by women. This chorale is sung
by the boys of the Thomas Schule, some forty in
number, and the effect of the contrast of tone bringing
it in is overwhelming. Poor Bach, with his miserable
little rabble of a choir with three voices to a part, can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
hardly have realised how his music would sound many
years after his death, when performed by a large body
of enthusiastic and intelligent musicians.</p>

<p>The next chorale in the work is</p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot105a.png" width="500" height="85" alt="O Holy Jesu how hast thou offended," />
</div>


<p>harmonised for four voices, and accompanied by violins,
flutes, oboes, violas and basses, in unison with the respective
voices and figured bass organ part. This accompaniment
is used for all the succeeding chorales, and we may remark
that the melody is given to the two flutes and two oboes
as well as the first violins, that it may be made prominent.</p>

<p>All the other chorales in this work, six in number,
are thus arranged and accompanied. The well-known
Phrygian melody</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 455px;">
<img src="images/illot105b.png" width="455" height="80" alt="Herzlich thut mir verlangen." />
</div>

<p>occurs no less than five times, sometimes harmonised in
the Ionian, sometimes in the Phrygian mode, and he has
arranged it in the latter mode as a very beautiful vorspiel
for the organ (Peters 244, No. 27).</p>

<p>We may here remark that in playing the organ choral-vorspiele
no notice is to be taken of the <i>fermata</i>, which
are only used when the melodies are sung.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Uses of the Chorale</div>

<p>Besides the choral-vorspiele, and the introduction of
the melody in conjunction with a chorus, and the harmonisation
in four parts, with orchestra doubling the voice
parts, Bach makes many other uses of the chorale. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, for example, he combines it with
recitative, the melody being freely accompanied by the
orchestra, and interspersed with recitative passages of the
nature of interludes between the lines. Or he harmonises
it in four parts, with free orchestral interludes.</p>

<p>The above quoted melody appears in the <i>Christmas
Oratorio</i> with brilliant orchestral accompaniment and interludes,
three trumpets, drums and two oboes being used
besides the strings and organ.</p>

<p>Erk has collected 319 chorales in two volumes (Peters),
extracted from the church cantatas, &amp;c., and has given
full particulars of the sources. Sometimes they are
worked up as fugues. Thus, the tune composed by Kugelmann
about 1540, and generally known in England as the
“Old Hundredth,” appears in the cantata “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gottlob! nun
geht das Jahr zu Ende</span>” in the following form, the voice
parts being doubled by strings, cornet, two oboes, three
trombones and organ.</p>



<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot106.png" width="500" height="313" alt="Nun lob mein Seel." />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The choral-vorspiele published in the Peters’ edition
number about 143&mdash;besides several sets of partitas or
variations on chorales, and many “Varianten,” or different
workings of the same vorspiel.</p>

<p>Although this eminently national German and Lutheran
form of religious art sank deeply into Bach’s soul, and
more or less influenced and coloured all his compositions
for the Church, he was accused at Leipsic of being too
proud to demean himself to conducting or accompanying
a mere chorale!</p>

<p>What he did was to allow his genius full play on a
form which intensely interested him, and to exhibit it in
new and original aspects.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Orchestration</i></div>

<p>The orchestration of the cantatas is of great interest.
It is generally known that Bach did not usually employ
the orchestral instruments in the modern
manner, but made each play an independent
counterpoint. Thus there were as many contrapuntal
parts as there were voices and instruments combined;
and a cantata was described as being, for example,
“in nine parts, for one oboe, two violins, one viola, one
violoncello, soprano, alto, tenor, and bass voices with organ
continuo,” or as a “concerto for four voices, two oboes,
viola and continuo.” Sometimes, as in “Erforsche mich
Gott,” there is a violin obbligato above the voice parts
in the final four-part chorale. In other cantatas it is
noted that the “cantus firmus (the chorale-melody) is
in the soprano,” or other voice. In the opening chorus
of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herr Gott dich loben wir</span>,” the cantus firmus
is in the soprano, the other voices sing throughout,
making the interludes which are usually allotted to the
instruments.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Bach was fond of dividing his violas. Thus, part of
“Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee” is scored for four
voices, two flutes, two violins, <i>four violas</i>, fagotto, violoncello
and continuo.</p>

<p>Or parts are written for a viola and a taille (the tenor
viol). In “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">O Ewigkeit, du Donnerwort</span>,” the scoring is
for three oboes, two violins, viola and continuo, with a
tromba da tirarsi (slide trumpet) in unison with the
soprano throughout. The cantata “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich hatte viel Bekümmerniss</span>,”
known in England as “My spirit was in
heaviness,” was composed and performed at Weimar on
the third Sunday after Trinity, 1714, on his being made
Concertmeister there. It is labelled “Per ogni tempi,”
“suitable for any season.” It has one oboe and one
fagotto, besides the usual strings.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A Mannerism</div>

<p>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es ist nichts gesundes</span>” is scored for three flutes,
cornet, three trombones, two oboes, the usual strings and
four voices. Here the cantus firmus is given out by the
organ in the bass with figures,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 385px;">
<img src="images/illot108.png" width="385" height="80" alt="" />
</div>

<p>and there is no further reference to it until long after the
chorus have entered, and have been singing contrapuntal
passages, when, without any warning as it were, the three
flutes, cornet, and three trombones, which have hitherto
been silent, bring in the chorale in four parts, the voices
and strings continuing their contrapuntal course. The
effect is so peculiarly Bach-like that we cannot refrain
from quoting a few bars.</p>

chorale being introduced in turn, with a never-ceasing flow
of counterpoint in the voice parts, accompanied in the
same way by strings.</p>

<p>If we examine the voice parts we shall find that they
practically amount to a double canon, the tenor imitating
the bass, the treble imitating the alto. But the canon is
not carried out with an iron-bound rule which would crush
all beauty out of the music; on the contrary, the imitations
are quite free and unconstrained. Each voice must
have its melody, even if collisions occur now and then,
such as between alto and tenor bar 15, last quaver: alto
and bass just previously to this: the consecutive sevenths
in the treble and alto bar 16, third and fourth quavers, or
the entry of the tenor on F♮ bar 17, against the F♯ in the
bass. This rough and healthy vigour is thoroughly characteristic;
the parts must express themselves by their melody;
if they happen occasionally to collide, this is of much less
importance than that their vigorous melody should be
sacrificed in order to sweeten the harmony.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Technical Skill</div>

<p>The string accompaniment must also take its part.
The instruments are all treated as individuals, not merely
as filling up harmonies. Therefore they do not reiterate
one note in each chord, but move about. The wind instruments
play in four part harmony which is complete
in itself. It might perhaps appear that this is merely a
display of learning and contrapuntal skill, but a close
examination of Bach’s most elaborate works will reveal
the fact that the greater the contrapuntal task he sets
himself, the more expressive is the music. Such choruses
exhibit the highest possible technical skill, but all this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
as nothing compared to the wonderfully artistic effect
that the composition as a whole produces.</p>

<p>In some cases Bach writes an organ obbligato part in
addition to the “continuo,” or figured bass. Thus the
opening symphony of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wir danken dir, Gott, wir danken
dir</span>,” composed for the election of the Town Council at
Leipsic in 1737, consists of the “Prelude” of the violin
solo suite No. 6 transposed to D,</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illot112.png" width="400" height="81" alt="" />
</div>

<p>on the obbligato organ, with accompaniments for three
trumpets, drums, two oboes, strings and continuo (to be
played on another organ<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>).</p>

<p>Bach seems to have tried every kind of experiment with
his orchestra. For instance in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Freue dich erlöste
Schaar</span>” an aria is accompanied by a flute, a muted violin,
the rest of the strings pizzicato, and the organ part to be
played staccato. One peculiarity, however, of his orchestration
is that the combination of instruments he chooses
for a particular movement remains the same throughout.
Rests occur in the parts, but there is no variety of treatment
within the movement. Thus in the above-mentioned
aria the lower strings having begun pizzicato play pizzicato<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
throughout, the first violins remain muted throughout, and
the organ plays staccato throughout. Again, in the opening
chorus of “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Es ist nichts gesundes</span>,” referred to above,
the wind never plays anything but the chorale in four
parts. Of variety there is plenty, but it is not produced
by modern methods.</p>

<p>Bach was just as careful in the choice of instruments
for his particular effects as in the choice of stops in organ
playing. Many of the instruments he used are now
obsolete, and their intonation must have been very faulty.
Yet if they had the particular tone colour he considered
fitting he would not hesitate to employ them, to the exclusion
of, or together with, the more manageable instruments
such as the violin, viola, oboe, &amp;c. Amongst the
obsolete instruments he employed to accompany the voices
in his cantatas and Passion music were violoncello piccolo,<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
viola da gamba,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> taille,<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> viola d’amore,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> cornet,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> oboe
d’amore,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> oboe da caccia,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> lituus,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> violetta,<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> violino piccolo.<a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Cantatas</div>

<p>Some of the cantatas are called solo cantatas; they
consist of a series of movements usually founded on a
chorale, for one or more solo voices, and contain no
choruses, though occasionally a chorale is to be sung by
the congregation.</p>

<p>The cantatas are often called by Bach “Concertos.”
Thus “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Bereitet die Wege</span>” for fourth Sunday in Advent
is entitled “Concerto à 9, 1 oboe, 2 violini, 1 viola,
1 violoncello, soprano, alto, tenor, bass, col basso per
organo di J. S. Bach.”</p>

<h2>Chapter IX</h2>

<p class="center">The Matthew Passion and B Minor Mass<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The
Lutheran
Services</i></div>

<p>It was Luther’s chief intention to make the congregation
take more part in the service of the Church
than they had formerly done. The first thing
therefore was to diminish or abolish the use
of Latin; and the people were made to sing
what they could understand and appreciate.</p>

<p>Luther translated a number of excellent old church
hymns, and made new tunes for them, being assisted in
this work by friends. The newly arranged hymns were to
take the place of the Graduals, Offertories, &amp;c.</p>

<p>He also translated and reorganised the chief parts of
the Mass; thus the Kyrie became “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Gott Vater in
Ewigkeit</span>,” the Gloria, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Allein Gott in der Höh sei Ehr</span>,”
the Creed, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wir glauben all an einen Gott</span>,” and the
Agnus Dei, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Christe du Lamm Gottes</span>.”</p>

<p>The Preface, the Benedictus, and Hosanna were left in
Latin.</p>

<p>Besides the chorales, he instituted the motet for the
choir, which was accompanied ordinarily by the organ,
but on high festivals by cornets and trombones. The style
of the motets was that of Palestrina and Orlando Lasso,
and the texts were chosen from the Bible, especially the
Psalms. On days of humiliation, a long Litany and several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
Latin hymns were sung instead of the Gloria. In Holy
Week and on Palm Sunday and Good Friday, instead of the
Epistle, the Story of the Passion was sung antiphonally
from one of the gospels by two priests before the altar.</p>

<p>But several inconveniences gradually arose. In spite of
Luther’s urgent order, “A priest <i>must</i> be able to sing,” there
were, in course of time, only a few who could, and those sang
badly&mdash;most priests could not even keep to a single note.</p>

<p>Let us imagine an unbroken monotone or monotonous
chant badly intoned, of the length of perhaps over one
hundred verses; and the service, being lengthened by the
addition of hymns, &amp;c., occupied sometimes from four to
five hours, all in one wearisome unison, and entirely deprived
of the variations which gave life to the Catholic
service. Moreover if anyone came late or left early he
was severely reprimanded.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The German Mass</div>

<p>Luther said, “We arrange the German Mass as well
as we can; our successors will improve it.” But for a
hundred years after his death men held most conscientiously
to the letter of his sayings, and when alterations were
made, they were done so sparingly that they were of little
effect. The Latin songs were almost all assigned to other
services, <i>e.g.</i> the “Rex Christe” was assigned to the vespers,
the “Crux fidelis” to Thursday in Holy Week, and the
singing of the Passion before the altar was changed to a
mere reading from the pulpit.</p>

<p>But when read, only a very small portion of the congregation
either heard or understood it in a large and well-filled
church; and soon there arose disorders, especially
when the old Protestant strictness of discipline began to
decline, and the Thirty Years’ War had produced much
roughness in manners. A way out of the difficulty was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
found, which must be mentioned, though it only lasted a
few years. It was certainly conceived in accordance with
Luther’s principles, but it was soon found to be entirely
impracticable. The congregation were <i>themselves</i> to sing
the Passion story. For this purpose a song was composed
by Paul Stockmann (“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jesu Leiden, Pein und Tod</span>”)
containing all the chief points in the story. Not only did
the composition prove entirely unsatisfactory in itself, but
can one imagine four and thirty strophes of eight lines
each being sung straight away to one of the dullest and
most monotonous melodies that was ever composed!</p>

<p>During this period, however, Figural music had, outside
the Church, been gradually developing in a freer and more
easily appreciated manner, and was therefore becoming
widely cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Introduction
of
Figural
Music</i></div>

<p>It found favour with the people, since there was no law
against its use, so that it began to enter the Church, not
in ordinary services, but on festivals. The result
was most favourable. We find expressly
stated the attention and the devout pleasure
with which the congregation listened to the
conjunction of song and strings. Gradually,
therefore, this music was received into favour, first on
festivals and afterwards on Sundays in the principal
churches, and that without any special care that the text
and expression had any regular connection with particular
parts of the Liturgy, much less with the special subject of
the sermon. The cantor and music director in fact did not
know beforehand what the subject was to be.</p>

<p>Everything else that had been used from former times
remained, except that after Frederick Augustus, Elector of
Saxony, entered the Roman Church in 1697, and organised<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
such splendid services in his Court church as had never
been before heard in North Germany, more freedom was
allowed in the Lutheran churches.</p>

<p>The celebration of the Passion remained as before, and
we have only to add that during the Fast and Advent
weeks all instruments, including the organ, had to be
silent, even during the singing of the thirty-four strophes.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Origin
of Bach’s
Passion
Music</i></div>

<p>At last there came to the head of spiritual affairs at
Leipsic a man of decided character, highly esteemed as a
learned theologian, a very impressive preacher,
and respected for his strictness of teaching
and life, Salomon Deyling, Doctor and Professor
of Theology, &amp;c. (1677-1755). He
could no longer endure the state of things
in Passion Week, and, since in 1723 the great and famous
Sebastian Bach had become cantor of the Thomas School
and music director of the two chief churches at Leipsic,
he associated himself with him in order to see if his ideas
could be put in practice. The idea which he propounded
to Bach was this: “The early arrangement of the service
was the best, but was only suitable to its own date: we
must try and make our arrangement on the model of the
earliest, but in keeping with modern requirements.</p>

<p>“On each Palm Sunday and Good Friday the history
of the Passion of the Lord is made known antiphonally,
according to one or other of the Evangelists, exactly in
accordance with the sacred writer’s words! Who could
improve on this? They must be sung, how else are they
to be understood by all? But they must be sung by
some one who can sing! namely by you: and so that
everything may sound well and be impressive they must
be musically sung, and accompanied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>“Your best singer, who can pronounce clearly and well,
must sing the words of the Evangelist in recitative, and,
in order to produce more impression and life and variety,
the other persons of the story must be represented by
other singers, and the Jewish people by a chorus. At the
chief points in the story there will be pauses, during which,
by means of an aria, the congregation shall lay to heart
what they have heard; and that all of us shall be refreshed
from time to time, there shall be well chosen verses from
all the known hymns, in which the congregation can join.
Now, your business is to carry all this out in a connected
and artistic manner.” And thus arose Bach’s Passion music,
which completely fulfilled everything that was expected of it.
However few there were who could understand and honour
and enjoy them as art works, these services, and Bach’s
method of treating them, were gladly received by the congregation,
and the performance of such oratorios became
every time a truly edifying and Christian artistic feast.</p>

<p>This account refers of course chiefly to Leipsic. It is
supposed that the decay of the performance of the Passion
was due to the pupils and sons of Bach, who tried to
improve on his and Deyling’s arrangement by the introduction
of Italian and lighter methods, which, though
pleasing, were soon found to be unsuitable to the simple
words of the Bible and Hymn-book.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Early
Passion
Services</i></div>

<p>The custom of performing the Passion in an epic and
dramatic form during Holy Week is exceedingly ancient.
It exists still in the Catholic Church in an ancient traditional
way, consisting of the relation of the gospel narrative
by one singer, the speeches of Jesus by another, while
a third represents the crowd called <i>turba</i>. Music and the
dramatic element are little represented, and the performers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
only make use of accent or intonations. In the Reformed
Church the performance of the Passion in German, and
in artistic style, did not take place earlier
than the last half of the sixteenth century.
Winterfeld finds the earliest Passion music
arranged for chorus after the Gospel of St
Matthew in Keuchenthal’s Gesangbuch, Wittenberg, 1573.
A short instrumental piece precedes it and another closes
it, and for the rest, only the words of the <i>turba</i> are allotted
to chorus. A similar work is the Passion according to St
John, which is found in Selneccer’s Gesangbuch, 1587, but
here there are hymns to be sung by the congregation.</p>

<p>The Passion according to St John, of Bartholomäus
Gese, 1588, begins with a five voice chorus, followed by
the gospel narration by a tenor in Plainsong. The words
of Christ are usually sung by four chorus voices, the words
of Peter and Pilate by three voices, those of the maid and
servant of the High Priest by two voices, the <i>turba</i> are in
five voices, and a five voice chorus concludes the work.</p>

<p>Heinrich Schütz, 1585-1672, in whose “Resurrection
of the Lord” modern forms are found, has very sparingly
used similar forms in his Passions according to all four
Evangelists, but chiefly in the concluding choruses. The
Passions in Vopelius’ Gesangbuch, 1682, show that the
early forms were still in use at that date.</p>

<p>The Passion of Capellmeister Johann Sebastiani, 1672,
at Königsberg, shows an advance in form here and there;
and here also for the first time do we find the artistic use
of hymn tunes, while in Schütz only the final movements
of his Passions have any connection with the chorale. The
biblical narrative is no longer in plainsong, but recitative,
accompanied either by two violins or two violas and bass,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
and this is the first example of instrumental accompaniment
in a Passion music. The <i>turba</i> are in four voice
chorus, with a fifth part in high tenor for the Evangelist.
Two violins, four violas and bass always accompany him.
The hymns are directed only to have their melodies sung,
the remaining parts being played by the strings.</p>

<p>A remarkable appearance was that of the Passion oratorios
at Hamburg, in which Handel, Keiser and Mattheson introduced
the regular song forms, the recitative, aria, and
the duet of the opera, and in such a method as only could
be performed by very highly trained singers. At first the
words of Scripture in their original formed the basis.</p>

<p>In 1704, however, an entirely new departure was made
in “The bleeding and dying Jesus” of Reinhold Keiser,
with words by Hunold-Menantes. Here there was no
Evangelist, nor were words of the Scripture introduced,
but three cantatas or soliloquies, similar to dramatic
scenes, took an important place. They were called the
“Lamentation of Mary,” the “Tears of Peter,” and the
“Lovesong of the Daughter of Zion.”</p>

<p>The novelty, which excited the fiercest criticism and
raised a great contest, did not take root, although through
its means a new way was opened up. For this attempt
led the Hamburg Councillor Brockes to write a musical
poem of a similar kind, in which the evangelist was
retained in order to fill the gaps between the scenes.</p>

<p>This composition, which was greatly admired, was set
to music by Keiser, and afterwards by Handel, Mattheson
and Telemann. The first performance of Keiser’s setting
took place in Holy week in 1712, and it is of special
interest, since Bach took some of the words for the arias
in his <i>St John Passion</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Passion Settings</div>

<p>In the <i>Matthew Passion</i> Bach follows that of Sebastiani
with the addition of new forms derived from the drama,
but enriched and ennobled by the mind of the Master.
Scripture words and hymns no longer satisfied his contemporaries
or himself; and as long as the kernel of the
work was scriptural, according to use consecrated by time,
no objection could be made to the introduction of what
had already been accepted in other services in the Church.
Only the soliloquies, those theatrical scenes in which
biblical persons appear with words other than biblical, he
would not introduce, for it was too like the stage. Thus
in a form, which though new, was intimately connected
with the old, did the <i>Passions</i> of Bach appear, and the
congregation took part by singing the chorales. It is
not known for certain how many Passions Bach wrote;
the number is said to be five.</p>

<p>Regarding the author and composer of the <i>St Luke’s
Passion</i> nothing is known for certain, for Bach gives
neither in his copy. The arguments for its being his
work are that it is in his writing, and is possibly a youthful
composition, and that he recopied it in later years so
that it should not be forgotten; while the chief argument
against its genuineness is its insignificance. The Bachgesellschaft
publish it with the above reservation.</p>

<p>It consists mostly of chorales in four parts with short
recitatives between them. There are few arias or choruses,
and a sermon is to be preached in the middle.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Matthew Passion</i></div>

<p>The first performance of the <i>Matthew Passion</i> took
place on Good Friday, 1729. The words, where not
scriptural, are by Picander. All the resources of art are
employed in this tremendous work. A double chorus,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
a ripieno chorus of sopranos, a double orchestra and
double organ part; a part for the Evangelist which calls
forth the very highest powers of the greatest singers; all
the instruments known in Bach’s time are at various
points brought into requisition. We have already alluded
(p. <a href="#Page_104">104</a>) to the effect of the opening chorus when sung
in the Thomas Church. The never-ceasing flow of quavers
in 12-8 time, the call to the contemplation of the Passion,
the questioning second chorus which finally unites with
the first, the solemn and dignified march of the orchestra,
have a devotional expression which has never been surpassed.
Throughout the work the words of the Saviour
are accompanied by strings alone in four parts, with the
continuo (which was never omitted in those days). The
chorales, which are of frequent occurrence, are to be sung
in unison by the congregation, and harmonised by the
choir and instruments. The words of the <i>turba</i> or
Jewish people are always allotted to double choruses, which
throw the expressions backwards and forwards at each
other in a turbulent manner (see p. <a href="#Page_123">123</a>).</p>

<p>The disciples are also represented by a double chorus, as
are the Christian congregation; and the music of the various
double choruses is in keeping with sentiments which might
be supposed to actuate the singers. The arias which fill the
“pauses” suggested by Deyling are allotted to an alto, soprano,
tenor, or bass, and are accompanied, in addition to the
organ, by two flutes, or two oboi d’amore, or oboi da caccia,
or by a viola da gamba, or by a violin solo with string band.</p>

<p>After Bach’s death this magnificent work was performed
at St Thomas Church till the end of the seventeenth century,
when it was laid aside until revived by Mendelssohn
in 1829, just one hundred years after its first performance.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>B Minor
Mass</i></div>

<p>The gigantic B Minor Mass was gradually composed.
At first it was to have been a “missa brevis,” but the rest
was added later. Hilgenfeldt<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> makes the following remarks
on it:&mdash;“This Mass is one of the noblest
works of Art, full of inventive genius, depth of
feeling, and astonishing artistic power: there
is no other of the same calibre which can be compared to it.
It was originally written for the Saxon Court, and was first
performed at Dresden. On his other compositions of the
same kind Bach has expended far less energy. It is possible
that a Protestant artist such as he was could not entirely
enter into the religious point of view which he was obliged
to take in composing for the Catholic Church, and several
of his other masses are merely collected from portions of
his cantatas.”</p>

<p>This is, however, also the case with the B minor Mass:
thus the Crucifixus occurs in the cantata “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Weinen Klagen</span>,”
the Hosanna in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Preise dein Glücke</span>,” the Agnus in “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Lobet
Gott in seinen Reichen</span>.”</p>

<p>The Mass is dedicated to Frederick Augustus in the
following words:&mdash;</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Illustrious Elector</span>,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Gracious Master</span>,&mdash;To
Your Royal Highness I offer in deepest devotion this
small fruit of the knowledge to which I have attained in
music, with the most humble prayer that you will look
upon it, not according to the poor composition, but with
your world-renowned clemency, and therefore will take
me under your powerful protection.</p>

<p>“I have for some years had the direction of the music in the
two chief churches at Leipsic, but have suffered several disagreeable
things, and my income has been reduced though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
I am myself blameless; but these troubles would be easily
overcome if your Highness would grant me the favour of
a decree, after conference with your Court orchestra.</p>

<p>“The gracious granting of my humble prayer would bind
me to everlastingly honour you, and I offer myself to do
anything with obedience that Your Royal Highness may
require of me in the way of composing church or orchestral
music, and to give unwearied industry, and to dedicate
my whole strength to your service.&mdash;With ever-increasing
faithfulness, I remain, Your Royal Highness’ most obedient
Servant,&mdash;<span class="smcap">Johann Sebastian Bach</span>.”</p>

<p>This letter was handed in to the Court at Dresden when
Bach was there on a visit, July 27th, 1733. The reader
will remember that he was at this time in conflict
with Ernesti, and the Council;&mdash;the title of “Hof
compositeur,” Court composer, was not however given
him until 1736. Though Hilgenfeldt says the B minor
Mass was first performed at Dresden, it is doubtful
whether it was ever performed outside the two chief
churches at Leipsic, and even there it was only done
in parts. On a score of the “Gloria” made in 1740
the note occurs “on the feast of the Nativity.” The
“Sanctus” also was originally intended as a Christmas
piece. The “Kyrie” is of great length; its score occupies
forty-six pages in the Bach Gesellschaft edition. Like the
rest of the choral portions, it has five voices, two sopranos,
alto, tenor and bass. The orchestra consists of two flutes,
two oboi d’amore, two bassoons, strings and continuo.</p>

<p>The Gloria is scored for three trumpets, drums, two
flutes, two oboes, two bassoons, strings and continuo. It
will be observed that for the joyful music of the Gloria
the tone of the oboe proper was considered more suitable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
than the perhaps more plaintive tone of the oboe d’amore,
which is used in the Kyrie.</p>

<p>At the very outset the hearers are made aware that a
work of unusual proportions is commencing. The words
<i>Kyrie eleison</i> are sung in a massive five part adagio with
independent orchestral parts, coming to a full close at the
end of the fourth bar. Here an instrumental “largo ed
un poco piano” commences and continues for twenty-five
bars; it foreshadows the vocal fugue, of which the following
is the impressive subject:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot126a.png" width="500" height="259" alt="Kyrie eleison" />
</div>


<p>After this fugue has been worked at considerable length
there is an instrumental interlude, and it recommences,
the bass leading off with the subject in the tonic. The
Christe eleison is set as a duet for two sopranos in D major,
and the second kyrie as a fugue, alla breve, in four parts,
in which the instruments double the voices. It has the
following stirring subject:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot126b.png" width="500" height="87" alt="Kyrie eleison" />
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Gloria” begins in D major, and consists of eleven
movements, opening with a vigorous five part chorus vivace.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot127a.png" width="500" height="159" alt="" />
</div>

<p>“Quoniam tu solus Sanctus” is a bass aria accompanied
by Corno di caccia, two fagotti and continuo. There are
no other instruments.</p>

<p>The Creed contains seven movements. The words
“Credo in unum deum” are a fugue on the ancient Plainsong,
which is in semibreves, with a perpetually moving
bass on the organ in crotchets. The only orchestral instruments
are two violins, which play independent parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Et incarnatus est”</div>

<p>“Et incarnatus est” for five voices is based on an
arpeggio figure imitated in all the parts:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot127b.png" width="500" height="255" alt="Et incarnatus est" />
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span></p>

<p>The “Crucifixus,” one of the most impressive movements,
is founded on a chromatic ground bass, which
recurs thirteen times, the four part chorus singing various
harmonies above it. This is the form of the Passacaglia,
and the same bass was used by Bach in the opening
chorus of the cantata, “Jesu, der du meine Seele,”
though in a very different manner. “Et resurrexit” is
another movement conceived in Bach’s happiest mood.
It is in D major, like the Gloria, and has, if possible,
even more energy and swing. This is the vigorous
opening phrase:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot128.png" width="500" height="398" alt="Et resurrexit." />
</div>

<p>and it is repeated for the words “Cujus regni non erit finis.”</p>

<p>“Et in Spiritum sanctum” forms a bass solo accompanied
by two oboi d’amore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Confiteor unum baptisma,” a closely knit fugue on
two subjects, is in five parts with an independent organ
bass. After a time the tempo becomes adagio, and
one of the most overpowering effects in the whole of
music introduces the words “et exspecto resurrectionem
mortuorum”; as it were the whole of creation is called
to witness the supreme miracle of the resurrection of the
dead.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Sanctus</div>

<p>The Sanctus is a six part chorus; the voices move for
the most part in flowing triplets, the bass generally in an
octave figure. After a time the triplets give way to the
following powerful passage:</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot129.png" width="500" height="404" alt="Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth." />
</div>

<p>after a few bars of which the triplets are resumed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>“Pleni sunt cœli et terra gloria ejus,” is a six part
fugue, and “osanna” is a double chorus. The “Dona
nobis pacem” has the same opening passage as the
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rathswahl</span> cantata. The work from beginning to end is
on a gigantic scale, in which each separate movement is
a masterpiece from every point of view.</p>

<h2>Chapter X</h2>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>&mdash;“The Art of Fugue”&mdash;“Musical Offering”&mdash;Bach
as a Teacher&mdash;Bach’s Works in England.</p></div>


<p>The <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i> was gradually compiled and
formed into a complete work in two parts. The first part
was completed at Cöthen in 1722, and entitled “The
well tempered clavier, or preludes and fugues through
all tones and semitones, both with major and minor
thirds. For the edification and use of young musicians
who are eager to learn, and for the recreation of those
who are already facile in this study. Collected and
prepared by Johann Sebastian Bach, Grand-ducal Capellmeister
and Director of Chamber music to the Court of
Cöthen, Anno 1722.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Wohlt.
Clavier
intended for
Clavichord</i></div>

<p>The expression “well-tempered” refers to the equal
temperament, of which Bach was so strong an advocate,
and many of the pieces would be impossible
with any other system of tuning. There is sufficient
internal evidence to show that these
delicate and beautiful compositions were
primarily intended for the clavichord, as
this instrument had a power of expression
which was denied to all the other keyed
instruments of that period. It is a mistake therefore
to play them on the harpsichord, and Spitta is right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
in his assertion that they require for their adequate
performance the very best pianoforte that the skill of
modern makers can produce. The larger number of
the pieces in the first collection were written at Cöthen,
and probably quickly after one another. According
to a tradition they were written on one of his journeys,
when he had not access to an instrument. Schumann
considered that many of the preludes were not originally
connected with the fugues. Bach made three copies
which still exist. He never had any intention of publishing
a work which would scarcely meet with success
among the general public from its difficulty. The
second part was completed in 1740 or 1744. The
only autograph is in the British Museum, add. MS.
35,021, of a page of which we give a photograph.
It is written on large paper, fourteen staves to a
page.</p>

<p>Gerber says that Bach valued the work highly for its
educational value, and played it through no less than
three times to him.</p>

<p>It was first printed by A. F. C. Kollmanns in London in
1799, but this impression was never published. The three
first editions were those of Hoffmeister and Kühnel,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a>
Simrock in Berlin, and Nägeli in Zurich, all in 1801.
The first English edition was that of Wesley and Horn,
1811.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]<br /></a></span>
<a href="images/illot133h.jpg">
<img src="images/illot133s.jpg" class="picture" width="500" height="378" alt="Preludium" /></a>
</div>


<div class="sidenote"><i>Various
readings</i></div>

<p>That by Hoffmeister and Kühnel was edited by Forkel,
who, selecting from a great number of copies, published
many of the fugues in a shortened form, believing that
these were Bach’s last arrangements of them. It is well
known that Bach constantly polished and improved his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
works; and the number of different readings of the
<i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i> would fill a large volume.
Amongst the more noticeable varieties of reading is
that of the E minor prelude in Part I.
In Litolff’s edition (Köhler) and Novello’s
(Best) there is a florid melody in the right
hand, above the chords, which accompany the moving
bass. In Chrysander’s edition it is explained that Bach’s
more mature taste led him to discard the florid passages,
and it is accordingly published from a later MS. with
only the chords on the first and third beats of the bar,
the melody being entirely omitted.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p>The “Art of Fugue” is a series of workings of a single
subject in many different ways. Like the <i>Wohltemperirte
Clavier</i> it was primarily intended for educational purposes.
Forkel gives the following account of it:</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Art of
Fugue</i></div>

<p>“This excellent and unique work was not published
till 1752, after the composer’s death, but was
for the most part engraved during his life by one of
his sons. Marpurg, at that time at the
helm of musical literature in Germany,
wrote a preface to the edition, in which
much that is good and true is said concerning the
work.</p>

<p>“But this ‘Art of Fugue’ was too lofty for the great
world; it became only known in the very small world of
<i>connoisseurs</i>. This small world was soon provided with
copies; the plates were useless, and were finally sold by
Bach’s heirs as old copper.”...</p>

<p>“The last fugue but one has three subjects, the third
being the notes b, a, c, h. This fugue was however in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>terrupted
by the blindness of the author, and could not
be finished.</p>

<p>“To make up for the unfinished fugue, the editors
added at the end the four voice chorale ‘<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Wenn wir in
höchsten Nöthen sein</span>,’ which he dictated to his son-in-law
Altnikol on his death-bed.”</p>

<p>The work was brought out at the Leipsic Fair of Easter
1752. Mattheson was loud in his praise saying it would
astonish all French and Italian fugue-makers. But the
work was in reality finished. The MS. was complete,
and the engraving was being done under the author’s
direction when he died in 1750. No one could fulfil his
intentions, and the engravers simply went on engraving
everything that came to hand, both sketches and completed
movements, and it was full of printer’s errors.
Hauptmann clearly shows that the last (unfinished) fugue
is certainly Bach’s own work, but that it has no connection
with the “Art of Fugue,” which closes in reality
with the fugue for two claviers. The series of fugues are
all on one subject; the unfinished work leaves the subject,
and has nothing to do with the other fugues. We have
therefore Bach’s last work complete, and the incomplete
portion is due to a mistake of the first publishers.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Musical
Offering</i></div>

<p>“The Musical Offering” is a series of fugues and canons
on a subject given to Bach at Potsdam by Frederick the
Great. The work consists of&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>1. Fuga (ricercata) for three voices.</li>
<li>2. Fuga (ricercata) for six voices.</li>
<li>3. VIII. Canons.</li>
<li>4. Fuga canonica in epidiapente.</li>
<li>5. Sonata (Trio) for flute, violin, and bass.</li>
<li>6. Canon perpetuus for flute, violin, and bass.</li>
</ul>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span></p>

<p>It is headed:</p>

<p>“Regis Iussu Cantio, Et Reliqua Canonica Arte
Resoluta.”</p>

<p>The dedicatory letter will explain its purpose:</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Most Gracious King</span>,&mdash;To Your Majesty is proffered
herewith in humblest obedience a musical offering,
whose most excellent portion originates from your noble
hand. I recall with respectful pleasure the peculiarly
royal favour with which during my visit to Potsdam your
Majesty was pleased to play to me a fugue theme, and to
require me immediately to work it out in your presence.
Obedience to your Majesty’s command was my duty. I
however soon remarked, that for want of proper preparation
the working out was not as good as so excellent
a theme required. I therefore resolved to work out this
most royal theme properly and to make it known to the
world. This project is now fulfilled to the best of my
ability, and it has no other object than in some small way
to do honour to the fame of a monarch, whose greatness
and power both in the arts of peace and war, and
especially in that of music are acknowledged and admired
by all. I make bold to add this humble request: that
your Majesty will accord a gracious reception to this small
work, and by so doing still further extend your royal
condescension.&mdash;Your Majesty’s most humble and obedient
servant,</p>

<p class="sig">
<span class="smcap">The Author.</span></p>
<p class="date">
“<span class="smcap">Leipsic</span>, <i>July 7, 1747</i>.”
</p>

<p>This dedication however only referred to a portion
of the work, which was gradually completed and engraved
later. The epithet <i>ricercata</i> perhaps refers to
the mechanical difficulty of the pieces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>The six Great or English Suites are so called according
to Forkel<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> because they were written for some Englishman
of rank. The same authority says that the six little French
suites received their name because they are in French taste.
It does not appear that the composer gave either of these
names. Both sets seem to have been written at Cöthen.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach as
a teacher</i></div>

<p>All accounts agree as to Bach’s wonderful capacity for
teaching, and we have a description of his
methods from one of his pupils, H. N.
Gerber,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> which we make no apology for
quoting in full:</p>

<p>“He went to Leipsic to study partly law and partly
music under the great Joh. Seb. Bach.... In the first
six months he heard much excellent church music and
many concerts under Bach’s direction, but no opportunity
arose which gave him courage to approach the great man,
until at last he mentioned his wish to one of his friends
called Wilde (afterwards organist at St Petersburg) who
introduced him to Bach. Bach received him in the most
friendly manner and at once called him ‘Fellow-countryman.’<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a>
He promised to give him instruction, and asked
whether he had practised fugues diligently. At the first
lesson he placed the ‘Inventions’ before him. When
Gerber had studied these to Bach’s satisfaction, he was
given a number of suites, and then the <i>Wohltemperirte
Clavier</i>. This work Bach played through three times to
him with unapproachable art; and my father counted
those amongst his most enjoyable lessons when Bach,
under the excuse that he felt indisposed to teach, would
seat himself at one of his excellent instruments, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hours passed like minutes. The end of a lesson was
taken up with figured bass-playing, for which Bach would
choose the violin solos of Albinoni; and I must confess
that the skill with which my father performed these basses
in Bach’s manner, and especially in the flow of the parts
amongst each other was unsurpassable. This accompaniment
was so beautiful in itself that no solo part that I
have heard could give me so much pleasure.” Gerber
was for two years under Bach.</p>

<p>Forkel<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> tells us that the first thing he taught was
his own peculiar touch, and for this purpose the pupil
was kept for several months at finger exercises, in fact they
sometimes lasted from six to twelve months; but when the
pupil’s patience began to flag he was given little pieces
which Bach composed specially for him, such as the six
little preludes for beginners, and the two-part inventions.
He wrote these during the lesson, and was thus able
to make them suit the particular requirements of the
pupil. Together with the finger exercises the pupil had to
practise all manner of ornaments, and Bach demanded
the severest possible application from all his pupils.</p>

<p>As soon as possible he was made to learn whichever of
Bach’s greater works suited him. In order to lighten the
difficulties, Bach played the piece through to the pupil,
and said, “that is how it must sound.”</p>

<p>One can, says Forkel, scarcely enumerate the many
advantages of such a method. Even if it were only that
the pupil is roused to emulation through the pleasure of
hearing such a performance, the advantage would be very
great. But in addition to this he obtains at once a grip
of the piece in its complete form, instead of having to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
work it out bit by bit as he gradually overcomes the
mechanical difficulties.</p>

<p>The instrument on which Bach taught was the clavichord,
on account of its expressive quality which trained the ear to
fine shades of tone; he would have nothing to say to
mere finger training apart from understanding the music,
and insisted on the cultivation of both art and technique
together.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Method of
teaching
Composition</i></div>

<p>In teaching composition Bach did not begin with
dry counterpoints leading to nothing, as in his time
was done by all other teachers; still less did he trouble
his pupils about tone-relationships, which in
his opinion concerned only theorists and instrument
makers. He started at once with
pure four part figured bass, and insisted on the
proper leading of the parts, because this would give the
clearest insight into the harmonic progressions. He then
went on to the chorale, to which he at first set the basses
and made the pupil only write the tenor and alto, afterwards
gradually making him write the bass. He insisted
at all times not only on the greatest possible purity in the
harmony, but on the natural and flowing connection of all
the single voices. The models he himself has left are
known to every connoisseur, and his inner voices are often
so singable that they might serve for the upper part. This
style had to be striven for by the pupil, and until he had
reached a high degree of proficiency Bach did not consider
it wise to allow him to try inventing on his own account.
He took for granted that all his composition pupils had
the faculty of thinking in music. If any had not this
faculty he was advised not to attempt composition.</p>

<p>As soon as the above-mentioned preparations in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
harmony were finished, he began with two voice fugue,
and in this, and all composition practice, the pupil was
strictly forbidden to use the clavier. Those who were
obliged to do so he called “Knights of the keyboard.”</p>

<p>In fugue he was especially careful about the part
writing&mdash;no voice must merely fill in the harmony, or
break off before it had finished what it had to say. He
looked upon his voices as persons, who conversed together
as in private society, in which it would be unseemly
for anyone to disturb the conversation either by uninteresting
remarks, or by not finishing his sentences.
On the other hand, he allowed his pupils as much
freedom as possible with regard to intervals. They
might try any experiments they liked as long as no
damage was done to the purity of the harmony, or the
inward meaning of the movement. He tried all possible
experiments himself, and was glad to see his pupils do so.
The whole of his system is to be found in Kirnberger’s
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kunst des reinen Satzes</span>” (Art of pure writing).<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Pupils</i></div>

<p>Among his pupils were his sons, of whom an account
has already been given. The others were the following:&mdash;Johann
Caspar Vogler, who began studying under
him at Arnstadt and Weimar, and, according to Bach’s
own showing, was a very fine organist. He became
organist and Burgomaster at Weimar.</p>

<p>Gottfried August Homilius, subsequently music director
of the three chief churches at Dresden, and
cantor of the Kreuzschule. He was also of
considerable reputation as an organist and church composer.
Died 1785.</p>

<p>Christoph Transchel, who died in 1800 at Dresden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
was an esteemed teacher and clavier player. He was
the owner of a considerable musical library.</p>

<p>Johann Ludwig Krebs eventually became Court organist
and music director at Altenburg, where he died in 1803.
He was a very good organist and composer. Bach’s
pun, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich habe in meinem Bache nur einen Krebs
gefangen</span>,” “I have only caught one Crab in my stream,”
was intended to show the esteem in which he held
him.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>J. G. Goldberg of Königsberg was declared by Bach
to be one of his best pupils on the clavier and organ.</p>

<p>Altnikol, his son-in-law, a fine organ player, and organist
at Naumburg. He helped his father-in-law considerably
during his blindness.</p>

<p>John Philipp Kirnberger, born 1721, died at Berlin in
1783, was Court musician to Princess Amelia of Prussia,
and celebrated as a theorist and composer.</p>

<p>Johann Friedrich Agricola (1720-1774) became composer
to the Prussian Court. He was more known by
his theoretical works than his compositions.</p>

<p>Johann Christian Kittel, who was organist at Erfurt
and died in 1809, was a thorough harmonist, a clever
and learned organist, an able composer, and a good teacher.</p>

<p>Johann Schneider, Court organist and first violinist
at Saalfeld, and afterwards organist of the Nicolai Church
at Leipsic. He was also a pupil of Graun.</p>

<p>Johann Martin Schubart (1690-1721) was Bach’s first
pupil; he became organist at Weimar, but died early.</p>

<p>A pupil named Voigt is mentioned by Emmanuel Bach
as having come to his father after he (Emmanuel) had
left the house. Perhaps he is the author of a “Con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>versation
between an organist and his deputy about
music,” mentioned by Walther.</p>

<p>Gotthilf Ziegler, organist and music director at St
Ulrich, Halle, was a renowned teacher, composer and
writer.</p>

<p>Ernst Bach, his cousin, was Capellmeister at Eisenach,
having first studied law, and become a barrister. He was
also a composer and organist.</p>

<p>J. H. Müthel, organist in Riga, a good performer and
composer. Gerber gives a long account of him, and
Burney praises his playing and compositions.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
music in
England</i></div>

<p>We have seen that the first attempt to publish the
<i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i> was made in London. England
was early in its recognition of the composer, chiefly
through the efforts of Samuel Wesley (1766-1837) who,
becoming acquainted with his works, eagerly propagated
a knowledge of them. Wesley’s edition of
the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i> was published in
conjunction with C. F. Horn in 1810; and
through his influence, Forkel’s “Life” of
Bach was translated and published in 1820. He became
famous for his performances of Bach’s organ fugues, or
as they were called in those days “pedal fugues,” and
perhaps the name of his third son, Samuel Sebastian, may
have some connection with his admiration for Sebastian
Bach.</p>

<p>In 1849 the English Bach Society was founded, having
as its objects the collection of the compositions and the
performance of the works of J. S. Bach. It gave the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
performance of the “Matthew Passion” in England at
Hanover Square Rooms in 1854 under Sterndale Bennett.
After a few more performances the society was dissolved
in 1870, and its library given to the Royal Academy of
Music.</p>

<p>In 1875 the “Bach Choir” was formed under the
conductorship of Mr Otto Goldschmidt, for the performance
of the B minor Mass, which was effected in
1876 at St James’s Hall, and the society was then placed
on a permanent footing for the purpose of performing
works of Bach and other composers. In 1885 Mr
Otto Goldschmidt was succeeded by Professor Villiers
Stanford, under whose <i>bâton</i> many of Bach’s important
works have been performed.</p>

<p>Bach is perhaps best known in England at present
by his organ works, which are familiar to all competent
organists, and his violin solos, which Herr Joachim has
done so much to propagate. The <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>
is a household word to every earnest musician, and
his <i>Passions</i> of <i>St Matthew</i> and <i>St John</i>, besides the
<i>Christmas Oratorio</i> and a few cantatas, are frequently
performed in London churches.</p>

<p>Selections from the organ works have been published
in England from time to time: by S. Wesley, by Coventry
and Hollier (with the pedal part arranged by Dragonetti
for double bass), by Best and by Novello with Best as
editor. A complete edition is being brought out by
Sir F. Bridge and Mr J. Higgs.</p>

<p>The Christmas Oratorio&mdash;The Magnificat&mdash;The Lost Works&mdash;Instrumental
Works&mdash;Bach’s Playing&mdash;The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Manieren</span>, or Grace
Notes.</p></div>


<p>Bach never wrote an oratorio in the sense of a sacred
dramatic work to be performed on a stage without action.
We have shown that the Passion settings are a portion of
the Lutheran Lenten services; and the church cantatas
take much the same place as the anthem in the English
Cathedral service, with the difference of greater length,
orchestral accompaniment, and an opportunity for the
congregation to take part in the final chorale.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Christmas
Oratorio</i></div>

<p>The so-called <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, dated 1734, is nothing
more than a series of six cantatas, to be sung during the
service on six successive days at Christmas time. Each
begins with a chorus which is followed by
several arias and recitatives, and each ends
with a chorale, besides which, chorales are
also interspersed in the body of the work. The
second cantata opens with a most exquisite symphony,
of a pastoral nature something akin to the pastoral
symphony in the “Messiah,” but longer, and with the
most subtle orchestral effects; especially are the passages
for two oboes interchanging with the strings most beautiful;
and the chief “motive” of the symphony recurs in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
accompaniment of the closing chorale. The character of
the choruses is for the most part one of triumphant
joyfulness, and the arias have all the tender effects which
Bach so well knew how to produce.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Easter
Oratorio</i></div>

<p>The <i>Easter Oratorio</i> is a short cantata without a chorale.</p>

<p>The motets are compositions in several movements
for unaccompanied voices, from three to eight in number.
The movements are interspersed with chorales
harmonised in four parts. The seventh motet,
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ich lasse dich nicht</span>,” though as fine as any,
is considered to be almost certainly not by Bach, and is
therefore only given as an appendix in vol. 39 of the
Bach Gesellschaft edition. The appendix also gives a
figured bass and instrumental accompaniment to No. 2.
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Der Geist hilft unsrer Schwachheit auf</span>.”</p>

<p>Motets by Bach and other composers are sung in the
Thomas Church at Leipsic, and in the Kreuz-Church at
Dresden at vespers on Saturday afternoons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Secular
Works</i></div>

<p>Bach also wrote a few secular vocal works. Among these
are several birthday, wedding and funeral cantatas&mdash;odes
for important personages; some “Dramme
per Musica,” two of which, the “Choice of
Hercules,” and “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tönet ihr Pauken</span>” are taken
bodily from the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>, other words being
adapted to the music; a cantata for the dedication of a
new organ at Störmthal, a comic cantata in praise of
coffee. Some of the secular cantatas were composed for
the Concert Society which met once a week about 1736
in a coffee-house in the Katharinen-strasse at Leipsic, and
of which Bach was the director. Among these was “The
strife between Phœbus and Pan.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Smaller
Masses and
Magnificat</i></div>

<p>Besides the B minor Mass Bach wrote four “short”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
masses of much smaller calibre, four “Sanctus,” and
a “Magnificat” in D major of great power and beauty.
This work appears in two forms, of which
one is much finer than the other, and is therefore
considered to be the latest. It was the
custom to intersperse the singing of the Latin
Magnificat with four chorales, but this custom not coinciding
with Bach’s sense of the fitness of things, he added
the chorales as an appendix to his score.</p>

<p>The work is for a five part choir, with arias, a duet,
and a trio. The trio is a remarkable canon, or rather
piece of canonic imitation in the voice parts, to the words
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suscepit Israel puerum suum</span>,” to which the strings play
an accompaniment, while the oboes play in their highest
register the chorale “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">meine Seel’ erhebt den Herren</span>”
(“my soul doth magnify the Lord”). And, as showing
Bach’s sense of form, the whole work is welded together
by a fresh working of the material of the opening chorus,
at the words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sicut erat in principio et nunc.... Amen.</span>”
We have remarked on this kind of construction in the
second cantata of the <i>Christmas Oratorio</i>,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> and it is not
at all infrequent with Bach.</p>

<p>Except opera and oratorio Bach wrote every kind of
work that was known in his day. The Bach Gesellschaft
completed the publication of his works in full score in
1898 in some sixty large quarto volumes. Complete
editions of the vocal works in pianoforte score and the
instrumental in full score have been published by Peters,
and by Breitkopf and Härtel of Leipsic, while the editions
of selected portions published from time to time since
the beginning of the nineteenth century are innumerable.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>
<p>But when we say “complete edition” it must be
understood as referring only to the works that have
been preserved, for a large number seem to have been
lost when the great man died: before his property was
valued for probate there was an unseemly scramble for
his manuscripts among his elder sons.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The “year
courses”</i></div>

<p>Mizler, in his “Necrology,” tells us the bare fact that
there were five “year courses” of cantatas, <i>i.e.</i> sets of
cantatas for each Sunday and holy day
throughout the year. The Lutheran ecclesiastical
year contains fifty-nine such days (six
Sundays in Lent and three in Advent are excluded). The
five courses would therefore require no less than 295
cantatas. Of these W. Friedemann took three “year
courses,” since he could use them in his post of organist
at Halle, but his wretched circumstances forced him
afterwards to part with them one by one.</p>

<p>Forkel only knew of “eight to ten motets for double
chorus,” and twenty-one church cantatas, two five-voice
masses, a mass for two choirs, of which the first choir is
accompanied by strings, the second by wind, a double-chorus
Passion with text by Picander (this must be the
“Matthew Passion”), a Sanctus, some motets, a single
fugue for four voices, and a comic cantata.</p>

<p>The other two “year courses,” which included about
ninety cantatas, and the two known Passions, went to C. P.
Emmanuel Bach.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MSS. of Works</div>

<p>The MSS. of the larger number of the existing works of
Bach are in the Royal Library and in that of the Joachimsthal
at Berlin. Many of these are in autograph. The parts are
of more value than the scores, since they are not only more
carefully copied, but contain the corrections for performance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Bach used to wrap up his scores and parts in covers
on which the name of the work and title of the composer
were fully given, while on the MSS. themselves
nothing was given. If the cover were lost, therefore,
the composer’s name was lost. Many works by other
composers are found in Bach’s handwriting, both score
and parts.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Difficulties
in the way of
publication</i></div>

<p>The Bach Gesellschaft has been at immense pains to
search for all that exists of Bach’s compositions. In
vol. vi. they give a long account of the difficulties
they had to contend with in publishing
the B minor Mass; the owner of the autograph
score, placing every difficulty in their
way, would neither sell it nor lend it to them, and
finally tried to dispose of it secretly to some unknown
person. They were obliged, therefore, to publish it from
such copies as they could collect; but almost immediately
after they had done so they obtained access to the
precious MS. and were able to publish an appendix,
giving whatever variations from their own edition were
found there.</p>

<p>Of Bach’s instrumental compositions the most important
are, as we have indicated, those for the organ
and other keyed instruments. He has left many orchestral
works, but these have not the significance of his organ
and clavier music, for the symphony, in the modern sense,
was not yet developed.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
playing</i></div>

<p>His playing is thus described by the poet Schubart:&mdash;“J.
S. Bach was a genius of the highest
order, his soul is so peculiar, so gigantic,
that centuries will have to pass before he
is reached by anyone. He played the clavier, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
flügel, the cymbal with equal creative power, and the
organ&mdash;who is like him? who will ever equal him? His
fist was gigantic; he could, for example, stretch a 12th
with the left hand, and perform running passages between
with the three inner fingers; he made pedal runs with the
greatest possible exactness, he drew the stops so silently
that the hearer almost sank under the magic effect; his
hand was never weary, and lasted out through a whole
day’s organ playing.</p>

<p>“The comic style was just as familiar to him as the
earnest; he was equally a virtuoso and composer. What
Newton was as a philosopher Bach was as a musician.
He had such a wealth of ideas, that no one except his
own great son can come near him; and with all this he
combined also the rarest talent for teaching.”</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Grace
notes</i></div>

<p>With respect to the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Manieren</span> or grace-notes attacked
in the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Kritische Musikus</span>” by Scheibe, a friend of
Bach’s answered the attack by saying that
by means of these signs no performer would
now be able to destroy the effect of a piece
by applying his own method; those who went wrong
would be put in the right way, and the honour of the
master would be retained.</p>

<p>The four chief ornaments are&mdash;</p>

<div>The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vorschlag</span> (appoggiatura)

<div class="inline" style="width: 174px;">
<img src="images/illot149.png" width="174" height="80" alt="Appoggiatura Written Played" />
</div>

It appears more in the parts than in the scores, and seems
to have been mostly added after they were written out.
When Bach required it to be played slowly he wrote out
its exact value in full-sized notes.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>The Trill (<i>tr.</i>) seems to have been put down rather
recklessly, perhaps on account of fashion. Thus, the
oboe sometimes has trills given it which are quite impossible
to perform.</p>

<div>Each composer had his own method of writing the
various signs and there was of course hopeless confusion.
There is no doubt that the trill was used to
mean three different things, at the choice of the performer:
namely, the vibrato of the violin and tremulant
of the organ, or a real trill, or simply a <i>tenuto</i>. The sign

<div class="inline" style="width: 296px;">
<img src="images/illot150a.png" width="296" height="80" alt="Appoggiatura Written Played" />
</div>

appears to be equivalent
to <i>tenuto</i>, thus

<div class="inline" style="width: 301px;">
<img src="images/illot150b.png" width="301" height="80" alt="Appoggiatura Written Played" />
</div>

</div>

<div>Notes which are neither detached (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">gestossen</span>) nor slurred,
nor held out, must be sustained for half their value, but
if the word <i>ten.</i> appears above them they must be given
their full value. These notes are generally quavers and
crotchets in moderate and slow tempo, and they must
not be played weakly, but with a refined and quite gentle
touch. Some of the signs can be interpreted by the fact
that they are written out in full in the parts. In this way
Reitz has shown the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Schleifer</span> (Glide)

<div class="inline" style="width: 89px;">
<img src="images/illot150c.png" width="89" height="70" alt="crotchet with glide" />

to mean

It was called in French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Coulé</i>, sometimes written<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>

<div class="inline" style="width: 177px;">

The <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Pralltriller</span> or half trill

<div class="inline" style="width: 120px;">

is lengthened when over long notes. It means no precise
number of notes. This is J. S. Bach’s own explanation,

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illot151c.png" width="400" height="174" alt="" />
</div>
It will be seen that all four signs mean the same thing,
and no turn is to be played as in the shake. According
to C. P. Emmanuel Bach it must be so rapid that one
does not perceive any loss of time from the principal
note.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></div>

<h2>Chapter XII</h2>

<p class="center">Innovations in the Fingering and Use of Keyed and
Stringed Instruments.</p>


<p>At Weimar Bach had devoted a considerable part of
his energies to the clavier, as his official duties demanded.
The harpsichord, being deficient in expression and in
duration of sound, required rapidity of movement and
polyphonic writing to produce its due effects. Bach did
what was possible, however, to use the legato style on it,
and on the other hand introduced on the organ, as far
as it would bear it, the rapid execution peculiar to the
harpsichord.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The fingering
of keyed
instruments</i></div>

<p>Before his period the fingering of keyed instruments
had not been reduced to any systematic
method. Michael Prætorius in his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Syntagma
Musicum</i> thinks the matter of no importance,
and that if a note was produced clearly
and distinctly it was a matter of indifference how it was
done.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>


<div class="figcenter" style="width: 500px;">
<img src="images/illot153a.png" width="500" height="88" alt="" />
</div>

<p>At the beginning of the eighteenth century the necessity
of some method seems to have dawned on musicians; up
to that time the thumb and little finger had hardly been
used, owing to their shortness. In order to play legato
on the organ, the middle fingers were made to go under
and over each other. Daniel Speer, in 1697, gives the
following fingering for the scale of C (for convenience we
alter it to English numbering):&mdash;</p>

<p>J. F. B. C. Majer, a Swabian organist about the same
time, taught&mdash;</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 400px;">
<img src="images/illot154.png" width="400" height="115" alt="" />
</div>

<p>There is no advance in these fingerings on the book
by Ammerbach, published in 1571.</p>

<p>The right thumb it will be seen was unused, and hung
helpless&mdash;the fingers being stretched out flat to reach the
keys.</p>

<p>In order to bring the thumb into use, Bach caused the
fingers to be curved and to remain over their respective
keys, so as to be able to strike them accurately and
rapidly. The thumbs had to pass under the fingers, and
to take an equal part with them in the playing.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
method of
fingering</i></div>

<p>The new kind of fingering was made the more necessary
by the use of all the keys equally; for hitherto only a few
keys had been used. The hand and arm were
to be held horizontally, the wrist straight;
the fingers bent in the natural position assumed
by the hand when about to grasp
any object. Each finger had to fall without disturbing the
others; and Bach devoted an immense amount of labour
to make his fingers independent and equal in strength.
He could perform trills with all fingers equally well, and
could play melodies at the same time with the other
fingers. After a finger had held down a note as long
as was necessary it was drawn towards the inner part of
the hand on leaving the key. The wrist and elbows were
kept perfectly quiet. The method was the same for both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
organ and harpsichord. The keys were not struck but
pressed down. Bach raised his fingers so little that their
movement was hardly noticeable. They were, however,
still passed over one another, as well as the thumb, and
in order not to break the legato effect, the finger passed
over was drawn back before leaving the key. This method
was particularly applicable to the clavichord, one of Bach’s
favourite instruments.</p>

<p>He liked the upper row of keys to be shallower than
the lower, so that he could slip down from one to the other
without change of finger.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Other Fingering Methods</div>

<p>But others were at work on the same ground. Couperin,
organist of St Gervais at Paris, published in 1717 his
“L’art de toucher le clavecin.” J. G. Walther used the
thumb, and has left some organ chorales with this indicated.</p>

<p>Heinichen and Handel also used the thumbs, and bent
their fingers over the notes, so that they struck the right
ones unconsciously.</p>

<p>Two short pieces with Bach’s fingering in his own
hand have come down to us&mdash;the rules laid down by
his son C. P. Emanuel differ from them considerably&mdash;thus
Emanuel limits the crossing to the thumb; Sebastian
prescribes crossing of fingers as well.</p>

<p>Sebastian, in fact, retained all that was advantageous
in the old system and engrafted on it the use of the
thumb, etc. His son, who was the forerunner of modern
piano-playing, simplifies his father’s rules. His compositions
were of a far less complicated nature than those of
his father, and he therefore was able to use simpler
fingering.</p>

<p>The hammer-like stroke required for the modern piano<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
effectually banished the crossing of fingers over one
another, by which pressure only, not a blow, could be
obtained. The loss of Bach’s complete method of fingering
(which is not adapted for the piano) causes his compositions
to be more difficult to the modern player than
they were to him, but this does not hold good of the
organ, the nature of which remains the same as in his
time.</p>

<p>He played equally in all keys, and for this purpose had
his instruments tuned in equal temperament, as is universally
the case at present. Experiments had been made
in this method of tuning by Werkmeister, who died in
1706, and, later, by J. G. Neidhardt.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Equal
temperament</i></div>

<p>The early experiments in tempering must have led to
curious results&mdash;thus the major-thirds were flattened; and
yet only when three major-thirds are sharpened (CE, E
G♯, G♯ (A♭) C) do they reach a purely
tuned octave. Bach mastered the problem
for himself. He tuned his own harpsichord
and clavichord, making the major-thirds rather sharp;
and he must have flattened the fifths as we do. His
son Emanuel speaks of his testing the fifths by tuning
their octave below, and making this a fourth below
the starting point. What he did was the result of
practical experiment, for he would have nothing to do
with mathematical theory. He always quilled his harpsichord
himself; and he made a point of practising the
clavichord, since the expression possible on this instrument
made the ear keener and more sensitive to the
possibility of effect on the more inexpressive harpsichord.</p>

<p>Spitta considers that Bach’s genius in a way foresaw
the advent of a more perfect instrument than either the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
clavichord or harpsichord&mdash;an instrument which should
combine the expression of the first with the power of the
latter, and at the same time approach the organ in possibilities
of legato and sustained sounds. Such an instrument
is the modern pianoforte.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The Lute-harpsichord</i></div>

<p>In 1740 Bach planned a lute-harpsichord, and got
Zacharias Hildebrand, an organ-builder, to make it under
his direction. It had gut strings, two to
each key, and a set of octave metal strings.
It had also cloth dampers, which made
the instrument sound something like a real lute; and
when these were raised, it sounded like a theorbo&mdash;it
was in size shorter than an ordinary harpsichord
(Adlung Mus. Mech. II., p. 139).</p>

<p>Although Bach was concertmeister, or leader of the
orchestra at Cöthen, it is not to be supposed that he
had any extraordinary facility on the violin. Quantz, in
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Versuch einer Anweisung</span>, etc.,” rightly considers that
for such a post, at any rate in those days, it was more
necessary that the holder should be a good all-round
musician with sufficient facility to execute the ordinary
orchestral music, than that he should be a “virtuoso”&mdash;and
not every virtuoso makes a good leader.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Knowledge
of stringed
instruments</i></div>

<div>His knowledge of the construction of stringed instruments
was sufficient for him to invent a new one while he
was at Cöthen, in order to meet the demands
made on the performer by his own music.
This instrument, which he called the viola
pomposa, was something between the viola
and violoncello. It was played like a violin, and had five
strings tuned to the four strings of the violoncello, with
the addition of E above the first string. This additional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
string makes the performance of his sonatas for violoncello
comparatively easy. Thus in the sixth violoncello sonata,
which is expressly written for five strings, in the third bar of
the saraband the chords

<div class="inline" style="width: 350px;">
<img src="images/illot158a.png" width="350" height="119" alt="" />
</div>

are comparatively easy with the additional string; and
in the gavotte

<div class="inline" style="width: 140px;">
<img src="images/illot158b.png" width="140" height="80" alt="" />
</div>

the first chord would
be played with two open strings, which is impossible
with a four-stringed instrument. He also altered the
tuning of his violoncello, as in the fifth sonata, where he
lowers the first string to G<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and obtains the chords

<div class="inline" style="width: 191px;">
<img src="images/illot158c.png" width="191" height="80" alt="" />
</div>

etc.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Practical Knowledge</div>

<p>It seems impossible that he could have himself performed
his violin and violoncello sonatas; they tax the
highest efforts of the best performers of the present day;
but his knowledge of stringed instruments and their
possibilities is shown by these compositions to have been
as profound as his knowledge of the organ. No mere
theoretical knowledge could have sufficed to enable him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to write these things; he must have had a wider practical
knowledge than any but the best <i>virtuosi</i>, and to this he
united his enormous genius for composition.</p>

<p>It appears natural that the German violinists, with their
feeling for full harmony, should have cultivated the art of
double-stopping on stringed instruments, rather than that
of pure melody and tone. It is said that Bruhns the

<div class="sidenote">Thomas Church Organ</div>

<p>There were two organs in the Thomas Church, the larger
of which dated from 1525. In 1721 it was enlarged by
Scheibe, a builder of whom Bach had a very good opinion.
In 1730 it was again improved, by giving the choir organ
a keyboard of its own, instead of its being acted on by
the great key-board as was formerly the case.</p>

<p>The organ contained:&mdash;</p>

<p>There were also Tremulant, Vogelgesang, Zimbelstern-Ventils
and ten bellows. The organ loft has been twice
enlarged, first in 1802, and afterwards in 1823. It
now accommodates the whole of the large double chorus
and double orchestra employed in performance of the
Passion music on Good Friday.</p>

<p>The smaller organ was built in 1489. In Bach’s time
it stood in a gallery opposite the large organ. It was of
very little use, and in 1740 was sold to St John’s
Hospital. It had three manuals, pedal, and twenty-one
stops, and was only employed on high festivals. As it
was at a considerable distance from the other organ,
difficulty was felt in keeping the two choirs together.
This gallery remained, and was used for musical purposes,
till 1886.</p>

<p>The organ of the Nicolai Church was built in 1598,
repaired in 1692, and in 1725 was thoroughly renewed
by Scheibe at a cost of 600 thalers.</p>

<p>The organ had been tried by Bach on its completion
in 1716, who wrote a very elaborate report.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> It may be
of interest to quote some of Bach’s remarks, 1. He says
that the space occupied is too confined to admit of easy
access to some of the parts, in case of repairs being
required. This was, however, not the fault of the builder
Scheibe, as he was not allowed the space he asked for.</p>

<p>2. The wind must be made to come more equally, so
as to avoid heavy rushes of wind.</p>

<p>3. The parts quite fulfil the description in all respects;
and the contract, with the exception of the Schallmey and
Cornet, which were changed by order of the college for a
2 ft. Octave (15th) and 2 ft. Hohlflöte, is completed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>
<p>4. The defects of intonation must be done away with;
and the lowest pipes of the Posaune and Bass Trumpet
made to speak less roughly and harshly. The instrument
to be frequently and thoroughly tuned in good weather.</p>

<p>5. The keys have too great a fall, but this cannot be
helped, owing to the narrowness of the structure.</p>

<p>6. Finally, the window behind the organ should be
built up as far as the top of the organ, or covered with
an iron plate, to prevent damage by weather.</p>

<p>The above list of 54 stops is given by Spitta, who
quotes from the “Acta” of the university; but a MS.
chronicle of Leipsic, discovered after 1880, of which
the references to musical matters are quoted in the
“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Musikalisches Centralblatt</span>” for 1884, has the following
entry:&mdash;“1716, June. This summer the beautiful
Pauliner organ, which consists of 67 stops, was finished.”
A complete list of the stops follows, but is not given in
the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Musikalisches Centralblatt</span>.”</p>

<p>During the concerted music, the organist had to accompany
from figured bass, and the voice part was rarely
given him, as the cantor would not trouble to write it
out, though Bach, with his characteristic thoroughness
did so in many cases.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
method of
playing from
figured bass</i></div>

<p>There exists a specimen of Bach’s method
of playing from figured bass in a MS. accompaniment
to a violin sonata of Albinoni, by
H. N. Gerber, a pupil of Bach.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> It contains
a few autograph corrections by Bach himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and it may be taken, therefore, as an example of the
manner which Bach approved of. It is described by
Spitta as of no melodic character, as being in four parts
throughout, and as not adhering strictly to the harmonies
given by Albinoni where an improvement was possible.
The adornment of a figured bass accompaniment by a
melody in the right hand was only possible to the greatest
artists, such as Bach himself; and it soon went out of
fashion.</p>

<p>During the seventeenth century it was the custom for
performers to elaborate the melody written by a composer,
and naturally Bach’s were treated in this way. But it
was complained that he left little for the performer to
add, for he “indicated all the <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">manieren</i>, the small
ornaments, and everything else that is understood by
‘Method’ in playing, by actual notes,” and the performer
could therefore not impress his own individuality
on the piece.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Bach was particular to show exactly
what he required; and it is evident that there was at this
time a school of musicians rising, who objected to superfluous
ornaments on the part of the performer. J. S.
Petri objects to extemporised shakes and right hand
melodies. Scheibe objects to contrapuntal accompaniment.
Kirnberger says that the accompanist should aim
at simplicity, and only add such ornaments as were absolutely
necessary.</p>

<p>If the pedal was employed, the left hand helped with
the harmonies. But if the bass moved rapidly the pedals
only played short notes to mark the essential harmonic
progressions; or the bass was even omitted, as the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
instruments played it. For accompanying the solo voices
in arias and recitatives the Gedact 8 feet was usually used
alone, and was sometimes therefore called the “Musik
gedact”: it is the same as the English stopped diapason.
The chords in a recitative were not held long, even if the
bass notes were. They were played arpeggio, as on a
harpsichord. But Petri considers that if there is a very
soft stopped flute, the chords may be held in the tenor
register and the changes of harmony indicated by a short
pedal note.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Organ-playing</div>

<p>Staccato playing was universal on the organ, but Bach
and his pupils insisted on a legato style, and gradually
eliminated the staccato, though in accompanying they
still kept to it. The tradition of Bach’s style of accompaniment
was carried on by Kittel a pupil of Bach,
who spread the knowledge of it through Thuringia,
and one of Kittel’s pupils, M. G. Fischer of Erfurt, continued
it. He died in 1829, and was heard by Grell of
Berlin (b. 1800, d. 1886), who described the performance
to Spitta. He played the bass with considerable power,
and accompanied it by short chords in the right hand on
another manual, thus agreeing with Petri’s direction
that the organist is to accompany in as short a style as
possible, and to withdraw the fingers after striking the
chord.</p>

<p>But this was by no means Bach’s only method of accompanying,
for he demands in the majority of cases
a legato accompaniment, and sometimes a “melodic”
manner. In his <i>Matthew Passion</i> and some of his cantatas
the organist is to play short chords in <i>recitativo secco</i>.</p>

<p>He considered the Gedact peculiarly adapted for
purposes of accompaniment; and in many passages he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
dispensed with part or the whole of the bass instruments.</p>

<p>In order not to drown the voices, or make the organ
too prominent, no reeds or mixtures were allowed to be
used in accompanying. They were reserved for solo
organ work, in which Bach made use of astonishing combinations
of stops. Orchestral effects were produced by
the contrasts of tone-colour in the different groups of
instruments, string, brass, reeds and flutes. To these
the organ, making use of diapason work only, formed a
background, and it was not allowed to predominate over
them.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The number
of performers
in a cantata</i></div>

<p>Bach, in 1730, fixed the number of voices requisite
for the performance of a cantata at twelve, and of instrumentalists,
excluding the organist, at
eighteen. His sympathies were so much
more with instrumental than vocal music,
that he treated the voice merely as an instrument
capable of expressing words. The influence of
Handel’s works, in which the voice parts were of more
importance than those of the instruments, brought about
the change of arrangements by which the singers outnumbered
the instrumentalists.</p>

<p>Students and admirers of Bach’s music have often
wondered how he could have got boys to overcome the
immense difficulties of its execution. They certainly complained
of the difficulties, but execution was at that
time, owing to the Italian influence, more studied than
now. Boys were made to practise shakes diligently every
day. They were not expected to enter very much into
the spirit of the music; it sufficed if they sang the
notes correctly. Moreover there were plenty of falsetto<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
sopranos and altos, and these could, of course, take the
upper parts. The tenor voice became a soprano, the
bass an alto. A falsetto soprano could sing up to E
and F above the treble stave.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>The pitch
of organs</i></div>

<p>The pitch question at Leipsic must have caused considerable
difficulty. The organ at St Thomas’ Church
was a tone higher than that of St Nicholas,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a>
and many of the cantatas have the organ
(continuo) parts in two keys, for the two
organs. There must have been a separate set of string
and wind instruments for each church; for the frequent
alterations of strings by so great an interval as a tone
would hardly conduce to good intonation.</p>

<p>There were in fact two recognised pitches in use,
called chorus pitch and chamber pitch. Of these the
chamber pitch was used for ordinary orchestral performances,
and was a tone lower than the chorus pitch,
to which the organ was usually tuned. This would
cause no inconvenience if the orchestras were not used
in the churches; but it is very strange that such a
troublesome arrangement should have been allowed to
continue after it had become the custom to employ the
orchestra every Sunday.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach as
<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Familien-Vater</span></i></div>

<p>One often hears in Germany the expressions “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Familien-Vater</span>,”
“Haus-Vater,” applied as terms of special commendation
to public men, in the sense that their private
life is of estimable character, that they do their duty well
by their families instead of spending their whole energy
in accumulating money or fame. To no artist could
these terms be more fittingly applied than to the subject
of this memoir. We have seen that he was unremitting
in his efforts to give his sons and pupils the
best possible education, and helped them
forward in every way he could when they
entered their professions, and how he
secretly obtained a post for his son-in-law, Johann Christoph
Altnikol, as a kind of wedding-present. Forkel
says he was a “<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">vorzüglich guter</i> (particularly excellent)
<i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Haus-Vater, Freund</i> (Friend) <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">und Staatsbürger</i> (Citizen).
His company was pleasant to everyone, whether a
stranger or an intimate, and anyone visiting him was
sure of a courteous reception, so that his house was
seldom without guests.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Choice of
Sponsors</i></div>

<p>An interesting feature in his private life is his choice
of persons to act as god-parents to his children. They
were seldom his own relations, but persons
of distinction, who might be able to help
the children on in their subsequent career.
Among them were Bach’s great friend, Prince Leopold
of Cöthen, his brother Prince August Ludwig, his sister
Princess Elenore, Privy Councillor Von Zanthier, Dr
Gilmar, one of the chief men in the church at Mühlhausen;
Gesner, rector of the Thomas School. Though
far from seeking wealth, Bach was sufficiently a man of
the world to see the value of ensuring a respectable
position both for himself and his sons by any legitimate
means in his power.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach as
choirmaster</i></div>

<p>As a choirmaster Bach seems to have been a failure.
He was far too irritable to be able to control boys,
and the task was evidently extremely distasteful
to him. Though he was sympathetic
in the extreme with those who
were in earnest in matters of art, it is very clear
that he had not the tact and patience required for
elementary teaching. One can well imagine how the
stupidity and incompetence of many of the boys who
came under him must have galled his ardent nature;
and he was quite unfit to be a schoolmaster. Yet it is
evident that he gained the confidence of some boys from
the fact of his having trained them to assist him in the
orchestra.</p>

<p>Of his own boyhood at Lüneburg a remarkable story is
told to the effect that when his voice broke he for some
days spoke and sang in octaves. It is of course quite
conceivable on acoustical grounds that the first harmonic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
may have been prominent enough to be heard with
the fundamental note; and that he, being a musician,
observed a phenomenon which would escape an ordinary
boy.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Bach’s
eagerness to
know all
that was
new</i></div>

<p>Throughout his life he was ever eager to become
acquainted with everything new that was of any value.
New organs, new compositions, newly-invented instruments,
were all a source of interest to him. Thus,
directly Silbermann of Freiburg had made a
few of his “fortepianos” in imitation of the
new invention of Cristofori, Bach was eager
to try them. But the hammerlike blow
required was quite foreign to Bach’s method
of playing, in which the fingers were always
kept as close as possible to the keys; and though he
praised the tone, he rather freely condemned the touch.
Silbermann was exceedingly angry and would not have
anything to do with Bach for a long time; but he, nevertheless,
set to work to improve the touch, and after some
fifteen years of patient labour succeeded in producing the
satisfactory instruments which Bach played on at Potsdam
shortly before his death. Hilgenfeldt considers that the
general use of the pianoforte took its origin from these
perfected instruments.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Public
concerts</i></div>

<p>In the midst of all his occupations Bach found time to
conduct public concerts, of which Hilgenfeldt quotes the
following advertisement:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p class="center">“<span class="smcap">Notice of the Musical Concerts at Leipsic.</span>”</p>

<p>“The two public musical concerts or assemblies,
which are held here every week, are still flourishing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
One is directed by Herr John Sebastian Bach, Capellmeister
to the Grand-duke of Weissenfels,
Music director of the Churches of St Thomas
and St Nicholas; and it takes place in the
Coffee-house of Zimmermann, in Catherine Street, every
Friday evening from 8 to 10 o’clock; but during the
Fair twice a week, namely, Tuesdays and Fridays. The
members of these musical concerts consist for the most
part of students, and there are always good musicians
among them, so that often, as is known, some of them
become in time celebrated performers. Every musician
is allowed to perform publicly in these musical concerts,
and there are usually some among the audience who are
able to judge the value of a competent musician.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Self-criticism</i></div>

<p>Bach was a severe critic of his own works. Hilgenfeldt
tells us that many of those which did not come up to his
ideal of what they should be were cast aside
by him, and that such of his youthful works as
he considered worth keeping were constantly
improved by him and brought to a higher standard.
Thus, the first movement of the third organ sonata,
which originally belonged to the <i>Wohltemperirte Clavier</i>,
was altered to the extent of having large portions cut out,
and others essentially changed and improved, so that
phrases of small significance obtained an importance of
which no signs appeared in the earlier composition.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Teaching</i></div>

<p>He reserved his teaching for those who could really
profit by it, and if he found that a pupil had not sufficient
talent, he would, with every kindly courtesy, recommend
him not to seek his living by music. The
result was that a strong feeling for the dignity
and value of art was spread by his pupils, who for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
most part attained to important positions in their profession.
One of his pupils, Doles, whose name had a
place of honour in the old Gewandhaus at Leipsic, was
Cantor of St Thomas for thirty-four years (after the death
of Harrer), and was held in great esteem as a teacher and
composer.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>A good
standing
always
maintained</i></div>

<p>Though at no time rich, Bach was never a poor man.
The various payments in kind, such as rent-free
dwelling, garden produce, etc., were almost
sufficient to support him, and to make
his salary available for self-improvement, for
journeys, and for the education of his children.
And that he was able to collect more than eighty theological
works, at a time when books were an expensive
luxury, and that he could give no less than three clavichords
with pedals at once to his son, Joh. Christian,
shows that his position was one of comfort.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Recognition
on his death</i></div>

<p>Though the Council and the <i>Leipsic Chronicle</i> took
little notice of his death, it appears that the Society
founded by Mizler caused a funeral ode by
the then rector, Dr Ventzky, to be set to
music and performed; and he seems to have
been much mourned outside Leipsic, as the chief support
of serious German music.</p>

<p>Not as a composer, but as a performer, however, was he
mourned. It was reserved for later generations to fully
appreciate what Hilgenfeldt describes as the “spiritual and
everlasting” side of his genius. In those days the composer
and performer were one and the same person. No
one was considered an artist who could only perform, however
well, if he could not also compose; and, especially
on the organ, good improvisation was considered the chief<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
qualification of a musician. He was expected to be in a
position to extemporise at any time and under any conditions
a fugue, or a set of variations on any theme given
to him; and his ability in this respect was the criterion
by which he was judged. It was natural, therefore, that
Bach’s fame during his lifetime should rest more on his
extempore performances than on his written compositions,
which, remaining in manuscript, would probably serve
chiefly as models for his pupils to work from.</p>

<div class="sidenote"><i>Portraits
and Statues</i></div>

<p>Four portraits of Bach are known to have been painted.
One, which seems to have been the first, is a half length
picture showing him in a dress coat of the
fifth decade of the eighteenth century. It
belonged to Kittel, and was kept by him as
a kind of sacred possession, only to be shown on special
occasions, or as a reward to a diligent pupil. It was in
a massive gold frame, and hung behind a curtain over
the harpsichord in Kittel’s study. On his death it came
into the possession of the church of which he was
organist.</p>

<p>The second was also a half-length, and belonged to
his son Carl Philip Emanuel. It was painted by Hausmann.</p>

<p>The third, also by Hausmann, is shown in our <a href="#Bachportrait">frontispiece</a>.
It is preserved in the Thomas School, and,
according to Becker, was painted on his becoming a
member of the Leipsic Musical Society. A fourth,
preserved in the Joachimsthal Gymnasium at Berlin, was
formerly in the possession of Princess Amalie of Prussia,
and seems to have been painted by Geber.</p>

<p>A few good copper engravings were made from the
various portraits, and a number of bad lithographs from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
the engravings. Some successful plaster busts have also
been made from the pictures.</p>

<p>Germany is much given to honouring those of her sons
who have distinguished themselves in art by erecting
memorials to them in public places: but not till nearly
one hundred years after his death was such a monument
thought of for Bach. In 1840, Mendelssohn gave an
organ recital in the Thomas Church, with the object of
opening a fund for this purpose with the proceeds, and
on April 23, 1843, a medallion by Knauer was solemnly
unveiled on the walls of the Thomas Church. The
opportunity was taken of performing many of Bach’s
compositions; and amongst those present was the last
descendant of the great man, with his wife and two
daughters. This was William Bach, then 81 years of
age, a son of the Bückeburger Bach.</p>

<p>In 1864 a large new organ was erected in the New
Church at Arnstadt “in honour of Johann Sebastian Bach,”
containing his portrait over the keyboards: and in 1884
a Bach festival was held at Eisenach on the occasion of
the unveiling of a fine bronze statue of the composer in
the Market-place.</p>

<h2>Catalogue of Instrumental Works</h2>


<h3>ORGAN</h3>

<p><i>The numbers refer to the volumes in Peters’ edition in which
each work will be found.</i></p>

<p>
<i>Six sonatas for two manuals and pedal (240).</i>     These sonatas
and the passacaglia were written for his young son, W.
Friedemann, to practise on the pedal clavichord. Many
of the trills, which are necessary on this instrument, are
intended to be omitted when the pieces are played on the
organ. According to tradition the date is 1723. The
first movement of the sonata in D minor appears in 1722,
as the prelude in that key in Part I. of the Forty-eight.</p>
<p>
<i>Passacaglia in C minor (240).</i>

<i>Trio for two manuals (243) and pedal in D minor.</i>       This trio
is overladen with grace notes in the fashion of the day.
The performer is recommended by Griepenkerl to exercise
his taste as to which he retains or omits.</p>
<p>
<i>Pastorale in F (240).</i>       In four movements. Mostly copied
singly. Forkel possessed a copy in which all four movements
were combined in a whole.</p>
<p>
<i>Preludes and Fugues (241).</i></p>
<p>
<i>In C.</i></p>
<p>
<i>In G.</i>       The subject of the fugue is the same as that of the
opening chorus in the cantata, “Ich hatte viel Bekümmernis.”</p>
<p>
<i>In A.</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fantasia and Fugue in G minor (241).</i>       Composed at Cöthen,
probably as an act of homage to Reinken. In one copy
the fantasia is called “prelude.” In another copy the
fugue is in F minor with a remark, “The very best pedal-piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>by Herr Joh. Seb. Bach.”</p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue in C (241).</i></p>
<p>
<i>A minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>E minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>B minor.</i>       The Peters’ edition is from the original MS. in the
possession of Sir Herbert Oakeley.</p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue (242) E flat.</i>       From the “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Clavierübung</span>.”
The fugue, like those of Buxtehude, is in three movements.</p>
<p>
<i>Toccata and Fugue (242) in F.</i>       The compass of the pedals in
this toccata shows that it must have been written for the
organ in the Lutheran Church at Cöthen. (See Glossary
“Orgel-büchlein.”) In the Bachgesellschaft edition the
toccata is called fantasia.</p>
<p>
<i>In D minor.</i>       Called Dorian from the flat being omitted from
the signature. The toccata is called “prelude” in some
copies.</p>
<p>
<i>Preludes and Fugue (242) in D minor.</i>       The prelude has no
pedal part. The fugue is arranged from the earlier violin
solo fugue in G minor (228).</p>
<p>
<i>In G minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fantasia and Fugue (242) in C minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue in C (242).</i>       This was originally in E major.
The fugue is in two portions, divided by nine bars of
florid passages. It was transposed to C for some of the
old organs which had only two octaves of pedals. In
Kirnberger’s MS. it is called “Preludio con Fantasia con
Pedal.”</p>
<p>
<i>Toccata and Fugue in C (242).</i>       The toccata is separated from
the fugue by a very beautiful aria, in which a melody is
accompanied by chords and staccato bass, the only
instance of the kind in Bach’s organ works. In one
MS. the toccata is called “Preludium.”</p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and double Fugue (242) in A minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue (242) in E minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue (243) in C major.</i></p>
<p>
<i>In G.</i></p>
<p>
<i>In D.</i>       The prelude is in two movements. The work, which
is very brilliant, is inscribed “Concertata” as if intended
more for concert than church use. In one copy the work
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>is called simply “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pièce d’orgue</span>, von Joh. Seb. Bach.”</p>
<p>
<i>Toccata and Fugue in D minor (243).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Prelude and Fugue in C minor (243).</i>      In some MSS. this is
in D minor.</p>
<p>
<i>Fugues (243) in C minor.</i>      On a theme by Legrenzi. A
second subject appears in the course of the fugue, which
after being worked independently is finally united to the
first in a double fugue.</p>
<p>
<i>In G minor.</i></p>
<p>
<i>In B minor.</i>      The subject is by Corelli.</p>
<p>
<i>In C minor.</i>      Probably written for pedal clavichord. Composed
at Arnstadt.</p>
<p>
<i>Canzona in D minor (243).</i>      In two movements. It was
popular, and many copies appear to have existed.</p>
<p>
<i>Fantasias (243) in G.</i>      In three movements of which the tempi
are indicated by Bach. “Très Vitement,” “Grave,”
“Lentement.” From the number of copies which exist
this fantasia, also called “Pièce d’orgue,” appears to have
been very popular.</p>
<p>
<i>In C minor.</i>      In five voices. In some MSS. called “Prelude.”</p>
<p>
<i>Prelude in A minor (243).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fifty-six short Chorale-preludes (244).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Three sets of Chorale Variations called “Partite” (244).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Some Canonic Variations on the Christmas hymn “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Vom
Himmel hoch da komm ich her</span>” (244).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Seven Chorale-preludes (244).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Sixty-three “Larger and more artistic Chorale-preludes” (245
and 246).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Four Concertos for two manuals and pedal (247).</i>       Arranged
from the Violin Concertos of Vivaldi. The originals were,
like Handel’s “Concerti grossi,” for four violins, one or
two violas, violoncello, bass and continuo.</p>
<p>
<i>Eight small Preludes and Fugues (247).</i>       For the instruction
of his son Friedemann.</p>
<p>
<i>Allabreve pro organo pleno (247).</i>      Organo pleno means a
complete organ, as opposed to a positiv, or one manual
instrument. It has the same kind of sense as our expression
“Full orchestra,” and does not mean that the
full force is to be employed the whole time.</p>
<p>

<p>
<i>In G “pro organo pleno” (247).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fantasia in C (247).</i>      Without pedal.</p>
<p>
<i>Fugue in C (247).</i>      The pedal only enters in the last five bars,
and is used in Buxtehude’s manner, merely to complete
the harmony.</p>
<p>
<i>Prelude in G (247).</i>      Composed at Weimar.</p>
<p>
<i>Fugue in G minor (247).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fantasia and Fugue in A minor (2067).</i>      An early work, in
some MS. called “Preludio e Fuga per il cembalo,” so
that it was probably intended for the pedal clavichord.</p>
<p>
<i>Fugue in G (2067).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Little Harmonic Labyrinth (2067).</i>      Consisting of three movements
called “Introitus,” “Centrum,” “Exitus.” Starting
in the key of C, it perpetually modulates, chiefly by
enharmonic changes, and finishes by a return to C.</p>
<p>
<i>Fugue in G (2067).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Fugue in D (2067).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Concerto in G (2067).</i>      Called also “Fantasia.”</p>
<p>
<i>Trio for two manuals and pedal in C minor (2067).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Aria in F for two manuals and pedal (2067).</i></p>
<p>
<i>Eleven Chorale-preludes (2067).</i></p>

only an infernal jingling and bellowing.” The complete

<h2>Glossary</h2>

<p>
<b>Ahle</b>,      Joh. Rudolph, was born 1625, and, after holding a post
at Erfurt, became organist and burgomaster of his native
town Mühlhausen. His chorale tunes are still popular
in Thuringia. On his death in 1673 he was succeeded by
his son Joh. Georg, who was a member of the Town
Council, and poet laureate to the Emperor Leopold I.</p>
<p>
<b>Böhm</b>,      Georg. Is described by Walther as a fine composer
and organist of St John at Lüneburg. Bach modelled
some of his early chorale-preludes, notably “Wir glauben
all’ an einen Gott” on Böhm’s style.</p>
<p>
<b>Brust-positiv.</b>      The name given to the choir manual when its
pipes stand in front of the rest of the organ, as in many
of the old English cathedral organs.</p>
<p>
<b>Buxtehude</b>,      Dietrich, 1637-1707, organist at the Marien-Kirche
at Lübeck. His organ fugues, toccatas, &amp;c., are of great
importance as having furnished Bach with his earliest
models. The fugues are usually in three portions, as in
Bach’s great E flat fugue (Peters, 242). Many of his organ
works have been published by Spitta.</p>
<p>
<b>Caldara</b>,      Antonius. Born at Venice 1678, a pupil of Legrenzi
and Fux, and the writer of many operas, and much church
music. He was successively Capellmeister at St Mark’s,
the Court of Mantua, and to Charles VI. at Vienna. He
was a clever imitator, but had little inventive genius.
On coming to Germany, his style improved in vigour.
Bach admired him sufficiently to copy his Magnificat
in C.</p>
<p>
<b>Cantor</b>,      Choirmaster. The office is rarely held by the organist
as in England, since the cantor has to conduct the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauptmusik</span>” with a baton while the organist plays.</p>
<div>
<b>Cembalo</b>,      or clavicymbal, or clavessin, or clavecin, for which
Bach wrote his clavier works, was in shape like the modern
grand piano, but its interior construction was something
after the model of the organ. It had, in common with
the organ, the defect of being unable to produce piano or
forte by the touch alone, this being done by stops. A complete
cembalo had the compass of

<div class="inline" style="width: 105px;">
<img src="images/illot206a.png" width="105" height="100" alt="F on fourth ledger line below bass clef" />
</div>


to

<div class="inline" style="width: 96px;">
<img src="images/illot206b.png" width="96" height="100" alt="G on fourth ledger line above treble clef" />
</div>



and two manuals. Each note had four strings producing
4, 8, and 16 ft. tone, two being of 8 ft. The strings were
sounded by plectra made of quill, called jacks. The
instruments were sometimes also provided with organ
pedals. It will be seen at once that a piece played on
16, 8 and 4 ft. stops would sound far fuller than when
played on the modern piano with only unison strings.</div>
<p>
The cembalo was used to play the basso continuo in all
concerted music outside the church; and even in a concerto
for clavier, a second cembalo appears to have
accompanied. The lute or regal, however, sometimes
took its place, for convenience of porterage.</p>
<p>
Transposing clavicymbals, and clavicymbals with keyboards
at both ends were in use. The tuning was very troublesome,
and had to be done before each performance.
Other names were Gravecymbalum, Flügel, Schweinskopf,
Steertstück. The claviorganum was a combination of
clavicymbal and positive.</p>
<p>
<b>Choral</b>      is the German name for the Plainsong of the Roman
Church. After the Reformation the name Choral (English
“Chorale”) was given to the hymns which were either
translated from the Latin, or originally written in the
fourteenth century by Johannes of Salzburg, Muscatblüet,
Hans Foltz, Michel Beheim, Johannes Gosseler, Jörg
Breining, and Heinrich von Laufenberg, and which took
a firm hold on the German people through the efforts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>Martin Luther, Michael Vehe, W. Heintz, Joh. Hofmann,
and others. The peculiar variety to be observed in the
metrical construction of the German Chorale is directly
traceable to the influence of the <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkslied</span>, for Luther
himself wrote sacred words for secular melodies. Other
names connected with the chorale are Valentin Triller,
Veit Heefen, Count Albrecht the younger of Brandenburg,
Culmbach, Speratus, Spengler, Hans Sachs, Schensing,
Decius Graumann, Joh. Walter, a friend and fellow-worker
of Luther, L. Senfl, von Bruck and Fink. Later
poets were Nic. Hermann, P. Nicolai, Calvisius Hassler,
&amp;c., H. and J. Prætorius, Neumark, Flemming, Teschner,
Gerhard and Crüger. The music of the chorale was
brought to perfection by J. S. Bach.</p>
<p>
<b>Chorale-Cantatas</b>,      those in which a complete hymn is carried
out, each verse forming as a rule a separate movement,
whether for chorus or solo voices, though occasionally a
verse is omitted in the longer hymns. Sometimes recitatives
break the course of the chorale melody, or the
melody is played by the instruments and accompanied
by vocal recitative. The chorales chosen are always
well-known ones, and among the finest of the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>
<b>Church</b>      Music. The services at Leipsic were regulated by an
act passed in 1540 by Duke Heinrich applying to all
Saxony. A morning service called matins was celebrated
at St Nicholas every Sunday at 5.30 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.M.</span>, in which the
Venite, Psalms, Te Deum and Benedicamus Domino
were sung by the choir, and directed by the St Nicholas
cantor.</p>
<p>
Morning service took place at 7 at both St Thomas and St
Nicholas; a Latin motet was sung, followed by the
Kyrie, Gloria in excelsis, Collect in Latin, and at St
Thomas a Litany was sung by four boys and the choir
alternately. The Gospel and Epistle and Creed were
intoned by the priest, and on certain days the Nicene
Creed was sung in Latin by the choir. The “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hauptmusik</span>”
(the cantata) followed the intoning or singing of
the Creed in Latin, and after it was finished the Creed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>was sung by the congregation in German. This was
followed by a sermon of an hour’s duration. The service
concluded with the general confession, the Lord’s Prayer
and blessing. Chorales were sung by the congregation
during the course of the service.</p>
<p>
At the mid-day service there were only a sermon and two
congregational hymns without the choir. It began at a
quarter to twelve. At vespers, the choir sang a motet, and
the Magnificat in German, besides leading the congregation
in some hymns. At Christmas, Easter and Whitsuntide,
similar services were performed for three consecutive
days, matins beginning at five instead of half-past to allow
more time for the festival services.</p>
<p>
<b>Cithara</b>,      Cither, a favourite instrument in the sixteenth century
of the guitar family, bearing 4, 5 or 6, or even 12 metal
strings. Prætorius condemns the four-stringed cithara as
being “a vulgar instrument only used by cobblers and
tailors.” In England it was kept at barbers’ shops for
the amusement of customers waiting their turn.</p>
<p>
<b>Clarino.</b>      Lichtenthal C. <span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Dizionario della Musica</span>, Milan, 1826,
says “the clarino is, according to some, a species of
small trumpet, of which the tube is narrower than that
of the ordinary trumpet, and which gives a more acute
sound; but Northerners hold that the word means the
ordinary trumpet.” The word frequently occurs in Bach’s
scores.</p>
<p>
<b>Clavichord.</b>      A key-board instrument having brass strings
which were neither plucked with a quill as in the harpsichord,
nor struck with a hammer as in the pianoforte,
but made to sound by a brass blade called a tangent,
which pressed against the string as long as the key was
held down. Although its tone had little power, the effects
of crescendo, diminuendo, and vibrato, called in Germany
“Bebung,” were entirely under the player’s control, and
on this account it was a favourite instrument with Bach.
The clavichord was sometimes provided with pedals for
the use of organ students.</p>
<p>
<b>Clavicymbal.</b>      See Cembalo.</p>
<p>
<b>Clavier</b>,      literally Keyboard. The German name for all keyboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>instruments, such as the clavichord, harpsichord,
spinet, instrument, &amp;c. The term is also applied to both
the manuals and pedals of the organ.</p>
<p>
<b><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Clavierbüchlein</span></b>,      little clavier book for Bach’s son W. Friedemann,
when nine years old, in 1720. A diagram shows the
keys and principal ornaments, and one of the pieces is
figured and called “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Applicatio, in nomine Jesu</span>.” Some of
the pieces are composed by the boy himself. Eleven of the
preludes of the Wohltemperirte clavier first appeared in
this book; some of the pieces are by other composers as
J. C. Richter and G. H. Stölzel of Gotha, and there are
many of Bach’s own fugues.</p>
<p>
<b><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Clavierbüchlein</span></b>,      vor Anna Magdalena Bach in 1720 and 1725.
See p. <a href="#Page_57">57</a>.</p>
<p>
<b><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Clavierübung</span></b>,      clavier practice. A work in four parts, consisting
of preludes, allemands, the Italian concerto, the
French overture, choralvorspiele, &amp;c., intended, as the
name implies, for educational purposes. The work includes
the well-known prelude and fugue for organ in E
flat, Peters 242, and the air in G with thirty variations
written for Goldberg.</p>
<p>
<b>College</b>      of Instrumental Musicians of Upper and Lower
Saxony. The full text is given by Spitta, vol. i. p. 145,
<i>et seq.</i> The statutes enacted that no member was to
settle in any town where another member was already
settled; no member was to take lower fees than his
predecessor; no member was to boast that he played
on a superior instrument to others; offices were only
to be obtained by proper examination; no member was
to sing immoral songs; every member must conduct
himself with propriety in social “attendances,” and to
see that his assistants did the same; no member was
to bring his art to disrepute by playing on bagpipes,
hurdy-gurdies, triangles, &amp;c.</p>
<p>
No bad language was to be allowed, and all low company to
be avoided; apprentices must, before binding, produce
credentials of respectability, and must serve for five years
with industry and constant prayer. After an apprentice
has served his five years he is to serve another three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>as an “assistant,” except when he marries his master’s
daughter, in which case he shall only serve one year
as assistant. In case of dissension arising, the matter
must be brought before six master-musicians, who shall
decide it. No man is to seek to oust an old master; but
if a man becomes too old to do his work, an assistant
shall be appointed who shall receive half the salary.
Every master is to see that his assistants are properly
paid for services rendered. In order that the art of music
may not be brought into contempt by inadequate performance,
no man shall be allowed to keep more than
three apprentices at one time (for this would compel him
to employ properly qualified assistants to carry out
concerted music). A master neglecting to teach his
apprentices could be punished; and an apprentice
running away could never become a member of the
college. However great the number of members, no
man was to be refused membership who was found, after
due trial, to be properly qualified. Questions of evil morals
arising among members were to be decided by a board
of elders.</p>
<p>
<b>Concertmeister</b>,      the leader of an orchestra who ranks immediately
after the conductor. In early times he was
also the conductor of purely instrumental music, while
the capellmeister conducted whenever voices were employed.
The title is also bestowed as a mark of respect
on musicians of eminence who are not connected with an
orchestra.</p>
<p>
<b>Concerto.</b>      A term applied to both vocal and instrumental
concerted music. Several of Bach’s Cantatas are thus
named; thus “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein Herz das seinen Jesum lebend weiss</span>”
is entitled “<span lang="it" xml:lang="it">Concerto à quattro voci, 2 oboi, 2 violini,
viola e continuo di J. S. Bach</span>.” Concertos for instruments
were in several movements, but usually three.
There was sometimes a single solo instrument, but more
frequently there were several. The fine concerto in G in
two movements is for three violins, three violas, three
violoncellos and bass without a solo instrument. The
concertos of Handel and Vivaldi, &amp;c., are orchestral compositions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>in several movements with or without wind
instruments. The Italian Concerto is a piece in three
movements for clavecin without accompaniment.</p>
<p>
<b>Consistory.</b>       The authorities of an important church, somewhat
analogous to the Dean and Chapter of an English
cathedral.</p>
<p>
<b>Continuo</b> = Basso Continuo,       the bass of a composition for
voices or instruments or both. It was always the lowest
part, and was usually provided with figures, that the accompanist
might be able to fill in the harmonies and
keep the body of performers together. It was performed
on the organ, or cembalo or regal, according to circumstances.
The continuo of most of Bach’s cantatas was
written out in two keys, to suit the two pitches in use,
“Chorton” being a tone higher than “Kammerton.” All
chamber music required the accompaniment of a cembalo
in figured bass; and even if there were one or more
“Cembali” obbligati a separate instrument would be
employed for the continuo. In all Bach’s church compositions
in which there is an organ obbligato part, there
is another organ part for the continuo. The conductor
stood near the organist, as may be seen in the frontispiece
to Walther’s Lexicon.</p>
<p>
<b>Cornet</b>,      Cornetto, Zink, consisted of a curved wooden tube
covered with leather and having holes for the fingers
with a cup mouthpiece like a trumpet. Two cornets
hang on the wall near the organ in Walther’s illustration.</p>
<p>
<b>Drese</b>,      Johann Samuel, 1654-1716, was organist of the Court
at Jena, and afterwards Capellmeister at Weimar. He
composed sonatas for the clavier, motets and operas.</p>
<p>
<b>Estomihi.</b>       Quinquagesima Sunday.</p>
<p>
<b>Figural</b>      Music. Florid music, or all church music that is not
Plainsong, or its Lutheran equivalent the chorale-melody.</p>
<p>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><b>Florilegium</b>      Portense</span>, a work containing 115 “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cantiones
selectissimas</span>” of from four to eight voices, with figured
bass for organ. A second part contained 150 “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">concentus
selectissimas</span>” of from five to ten parts. Published 1603
and 1621 by Bodenschatz, Cantor of Schulpforta, and
Pastor at Rehausen. A complete catalogue is given in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>Groves’ Dictionary, vol. i. p. 253.</p>
<p>
<b>French</b>      Overture. A form of opera overture consisting of a
slow introduction, followed by a fugue or fugato, and
concluding with a slow movement. This form was applied
to the clavier by Bach in the “Overture in the French
style” (E. P. 208) of the B minor Suite or Partita.</p>
<p>
<b>Fux</b>,      Joh. Joseph, born in Styria, 1660, organist, Court composer,
and Capellmeister at Vienna. A prolific composer
of church music and opera, but he is best known by his
theoretical works, amongst which is his Latin “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gradus
ad Parnassum</span>,” a treatise on composition, which has
been through many editions.</p>
<p>
<b>Görner</b>,      J. Gottlieb, was appointed organist of the Nicolai
Church at Leipsic in 1721 and was also head of a
“Collegium Musicum” or musical society. In 1729 he
succeeded Gräbner as organist of St Thomas. He was
a mediocre musician, but put himself in rivalry with Bach,
and is reported by Scheibe to have “by his rudeness
asserted his pre-eminence among a large number of his
equals.” He gave Bach a good deal of trouble by assuming
the position and emoluments of director of music
to the University; but they appear to have worked
amicably together afterwards, and Bach, by will, appointed
him guardian of his children, an office which he appears
to have satisfactorily fulfilled.</p>
<p>
<b>Hammerschmidt</b>,      Andreas, born in Bohemia, 1611, organist of
Freiberg, afterwards at Zittau. According to Gerber,
one of the greatest of German contrapuntists. Walther
gives a list of his compositions, which are mostly for the
church. His “Musical discourses on the Gospel” were
an important step in the development of oratorio.</p>
<p>
<b>Hunold</b>,      Christian Friedrich. A poet, known as Menantes,
who wrote poems for the Hamburg Theatre 1700 to 1706;
became a professor at Halle, and was much at the Cöthen
Court, where he wrote texts for Bach’s cantatas.</p>
<p>
<b>Instrument.</b>       A name given to a keyed instrument of which
the strings went from side to side as in the obsolete
square pianoforte, the key-board being in the middle.</p>
<p>
<b>Inventions.</b>       The fifteen Inventions and Symphonies were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>entitled by Bach “A genuine introduction whereby a
clear method is shown to lovers of the clavier, and
especially to those who are eager to learn, not only (1)
of playing in two voices clearly, but also, on making
further progress, (2) of playing three obbligato parts
properly and well; so that they at the same time will
learn to make good inventions and play them themselves,
and will also learn what is most important, the art of
cantabile playing; and will acquire a good taste in
composition. Prepared by J. S. Bach, 1723.”</p>
<p>
<b>Keiser</b>,      Reinhard, was for forty years the celebrated composer
and conductor of operas at Hamburg. He had as colleagues
Telemann and Matheson. He wrote 116 operas,
and produced many by other composers, particularly
Handel’s Rinaldo. Born near Leipsic, 1673, died 1739.</p>
<p>
<b>Kuhnau</b>,      Johann, 1667-1722, Bach’s predecessor as cantor at
the Thomas-schule, was a prolific writer on musical subjects.
Amongst his compositions are six Bible sonatas,
representing scenes from Scripture on the cembalo. He
was the first to write chamber sonatas for the clavier
instead of for several instruments. He was also learned
in languages, mathematics, and law. He wrote passions,
cantatas, &amp;c., but his style seems to have soon become
antiquated, and his works could not hold their own
against the opera and the younger school.</p>
<p>
<b>Lituus.</b>      The cantata No. 118, “O Jesu Christ mein’s Leben’s
Licht,” is scored for two litui, cornet and three trombones.
There are no string or organ parts, and the work is
evidently intended for the open air, perhaps for a funeral.
There is no reason given for calling the trumpets by their
Latin name in this instance.</p>
<p>
<b>Lute.</b>       This instrument appears in the score of the St John’s
Passion. It was sometimes used instead of a clavecin
to accompany concerted music.</p>
<p>
<b>Lute-Harpsichord.</b>       A keyed instrument with gut strings made
after Bach’s design by Zacharias Hildebrand, an organ
builder. See p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Matheson</b>,       1681-1764, wrote 89 volumes chiefly on musical
subjects, besides being a composer. He was a classical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>scholar, a student of modern languages, law, and political
science, a good musician, dancer, and fencer. He appeared
on the Hamburg stage as a singer, composed
and conducted operas there, became a great friend of
Handel, was made secretary of the English Legation,
and cantor and canon of the Cathedral. By his writings
he materially helped forward the development of the
church cantata.</p>
<p>
<b>Mizler</b>,      von Kolof, Doctor of Philosophy and historian, born
1711 at Wurtemberg, was a good amateur musician. In
1731 he went to Leipsic to study divinity and afterwards
philosophy and music. Here he founded a “Society for
Musical Science,” and became on friendly terms with
Bach, who seems to have given him some lessons. He
wrote various works dealing with the philosophy of
music; and his chief importance in connection with
Bach was his “Necrology” in which he gives valuable
information concerning him. The work is in several
numbers; unfortunately that portion of it which deals
with Bach is not in the British Museum Library.</p>
<p>
<b>Motet.</b>      The character and scope of the German motet are
thus described by Spitta, vol. i. p. 54. “It is in several
parts; it admits of no obbligato instruments, and its
subjects are set to a text of the Bible, or to a verse of
a hymn. The period of its fullest bloom was about 1600,
when music was essentially polyphonic, vocal, and sacred.”
Under the influence of harmony it gradually changed its
form, introducing solo voices and instruments, especially
the organ.</p>
<p>
<b>Oboe</b>      da Caccia. Hunting oboe, bent like a knee, and differing
but slightly from the modern Cor Anglais, or English
horn. It occurs very frequently in Bach’s scores. It is
described in Grove’s Dictionary as a bassoon raised a
fourth, carrying the bass tone of the latter upwards rather
than lowering the treble tone of the oboe a fifth. It is also
called by Bach, Taille de basson, or tenor of the bassoon.</p>
<p>
<b>Oberwerk.</b>      The Great organ.</p>
<p>
<b>Oberpositiv.</b>      A choir organ of which the wind-chest is placed
above the others.</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span><b>Orgel-büchlein</b>,      “Little organ-book.” The first collection was
made, according to Bach himself, at Cöthen between
1717 and 1723. The second collection, consisting of six
chorales, was published and sold by Bach and his sons
at Leipsic, Halle, and Berlin. The third collection was
continued till his death and was not published. The
last portion was dictated during his blindness to his
son-in-law Altnikol. The two unpublished parts were
written on two staves only. The pedal compass in the
chorales extends to high F and F♯. These notes were
found on the organ of the Lutheran Church at Cöthen
only. This organ is described by Hartmann in 1803
as “an uncommonly powerful and excellent instrument.”
It had 8 stops on the pedals, 10 on the great, 10 on the
choir. It is now reduced in size and ruined in order to
obtain more room in the church.</p>
<p>
<b>Partita.</b>       A name given to sets of variations for organ or
cembalo, and appropriated from the town pipers.</p>
<p>
<b>Pachelbel</b>,      Johann, 1653-1706, born at Nüremberg, was assistant
organist at the Church of St Stephen in Vienna,
whence he moved to Eisenach as Court organist in 1677.
From Eisenach he went to Erfurt and to Gehren. In
1690 he became Court organist at Stuttgart; and after
a stay of three years at Gotha he became organist of
a church at Nüremberg till his death. He taught W.
Friedemann Bach, and Bernhard, son of Ægidius. According
to Gerber, he improved church music, used the
overture form on the clavier, and continued the good
work which Froberger had begun in respect of clavier
composition. Bach used his chorales as models during
the Arnstadt period.</p>
<p>
<b>Picander.</b>      A poet of considerable reputation in his time named
Christian Friedrich Henrici. Born 1700 at Stolpen. Went
to the University at Leipsic, 1720. Became a lawyer, but
was afterwards able to live by his poetical compositions,
though he obtained important posts in Leipsic. Died
1764. He wrote the text for many of Bach’s compositions.</p>
<p>
<b>Positiv.</b>      The name given to that portion of an organ and its
manual which corresponds to our choir organ. In a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>three manual organ there are usually two choir manuals.
The swell shutters, if any, are only applied to a few stops,
used generally on a fourth or “echo” manual. Properly
speaking the positive, called in Italian organs, piccolo,
had its foundation pipes pitched an octave higher than
those of the ordinary organ. Its diapason would therefore
be a four-feet register.</p>
<p>
<b>Regal.</b>      Sometimes used to accompany secular cantatas instead
of the clavecin. It was also used for choir practices.
In 1709 Kuhnau in a Memorial to the Council says, “A
new regal is needed, the old one being constantly in
need of repair.” An inventory of the instruments at the
Thomas-schule between 1723 and 1750 mentions, “1
Regal, old and quite done for”; “1 ditto bought 1696.”</p>
<p>
The regal was a small reed instrument of the harmonium
class, but with small pipes to enhance the sound of the
reeds. It could easily be carried about, and was placed
on a table when played. It could be made so small as to
take the size and shape of a large book, hence sometimes
called Book or Bible-regal.</p>
<p>
<b>Schubart</b>,      Christian F. Daniel. Born 1739. Master of Philosophy,
Theatre director, Court poet of Stuttgart, a good
amateur musician. Was a good organist and held various
posts. In 1777 to 1787 he was imprisoned in a castle on
account of some views expressed in his political paper
“Deutsche Chronik.” Burney, who met him, remarks
on his great facility as a clavier player. He published
several compositions and works on music.</p>
<p>
<b>Schütz</b>,      Heinrich. 1585-1672. Brought opera from Italy to
Germany and also composed Passions. He was considered
the best German composer of his century. He
wrote music to the Passions of Matthew, Luke and John
for the Court of Dresden, where he was Capellmeister.
These are the greatest works of the kind next to those
of Bach. His compositions are in the old church tones,
but strongly influenced by the coming tonality of modern
music.</p>
<p>
<b>Solo</b>      Cantatas. Those written for one or more solo voices
without a chorus. They sometimes conclude with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>chorale in four parts.</p>
<p>
<b>Spinet.</b>      Is defined by Hipkins (“The Pianoforte,” p. 121) as
“a Jack keyboard instrument with one string to a note,”
as opposed to the cembalo, harpsichord, &amp;c., which had
several strings to a note. Adlung says the spinet was
of limited compass, its lowest octave being “short” and
it was tuned a fifth above chorus pitch. It was sometimes
triangular in shape and could be placed on a table; its
strings ran from right to left of the performer, as in the
“Instrument.”</p>
<p>
<b><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Rück-positiv</span>.</b>      The name given to the choir manual when its
pipes stand behind the rest of the organ.</p>
<p>
<b>Telemann</b>,      G. Philipp. 1681-1767. A poet and musician who
composed no less than 600 overtures, 12 complete year
courses of cantatas, 44 passions, 32 compositions for the
instalment of preachers, 32 so-called oratorios, 20 coronation
pieces, 40 operas, and a mass of other music. Besides
all this he is described by Walther as the “greatest Polygraph
that Germany can show,” having written a number
of books on music, besides a quantity of bad poetry. He
was successively organist and director of the New Church
at Leipsic (during which time he mastered the English,
Italian and French languages), Capellmeister in Sorau,
Concertmeister in Eisenach, Kapellmeister at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
Music Director at Hamburg, where he
formed one of the trio of musicians, Keiser and Matheson
being the others. He was on very friendly terms with Bach
and Handel. He was a candidate for the post of Cantor
at St Thomas, having during his previous residence in
Leipsic (1701-4) founded a flourishing “Collegium Musicum”
among the students. He had a great reputation
throughout Germany. Bach copied some of his music,
and the influence of Telemann, at that time very popular,
is seen in Bach’s cantata “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herr Gott dich loben wir</span>.”</p>
<p>
<b>Theorbo.</b>      A lute with an extra neck bearing the bass strings.</p>
<p>
<b>Tromba</b>      da tirarsi. A slide trumpet, the soprano of the
trombone. Often used in Bach’s scores.</p>
<p>
<b>Viola</b>      d’amore. A tenor viol of a specially agreeable and
silvery tone (Walther). It sometimes had sympathetic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>strings, though these were not a necessary adjunct.</p>
<p>
<b>Viola</b>      da gamba. Leg viol, the bass of the viol family, held
between the knees, like the violoncello, when played. It
had six strings, the lowest of which was the D below the
bass stave, and its finger-board was fretted. Its tone
(like that of all the viol class) was weak compared to the
violoncello.</p>
<p>
<b>Viola</b>      pomposa, an instrument invented by Bach. See p. <a href="#Page_157">157</a>.</p>
<p>
<b>Violetta.</b>      This instrument occurs in the cantata “Herr Gott
dich loben wir” as an alternative of the “oboe di caccia.”
It is described by Walther as a fiddle (<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Geige</span>) playing
an inner part, constructed like a viola, or small viola
da gamba.</p>
<p>
<b>Violino</b>      piccolo. A small violin whose lowest string was a
fourth higher than that of the violin. Its tuning was
therefore C, G, D, A, an octave above the viola. It
frequently occurs in Bach’s scores.</p>
<p>
<b>Violoncello</b>      piccolo, with five strings. This instrument occurs
in the score of a tenor aria in cantata No. 41, “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Jesu nur
sei gepreiset</span>.” The additional string was tuned to E,
and enabled the performer to execute the very florid
high passages which Bach writes.</p>
<p>
<b>Ziegler</b>,      Christiane Mariane von, who wrote words for some
of the cantatas was born in 1695 at Leipsic. Began to
publish poems when she was fifteen. Left a widow in
1722, she devoted herself to writing poetry and the practice
of the keyboard instruments and lute, and flute, and was
held in honour by the most artistic society of her time.
Spitta gives an account of her life in Curtius’ <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Historische
Aufsätze</span>, 1884. See p. <a href="#Page_197">197</a>.

Kellner kindly gave me the following information. The
descendants of J. S. Bach’s eldest brother continued to live in
Ohrdruf until 1863, as cantors, clergymen, schoolmasters, lawyers,
etc. There are at present living in direct descent Herr Herrmann
Julius Bach, Merchant, of Budapest, Herr Alfred Wilhelm Bach,
Apothecary, of Witten, and two young sons of the latter.</p></div>

the post of organist at this church was one of the best in Germany.
It had one drawback, however; on the resignation or death of an
organist, the person appointed to succeed him was obliged to marry
his daughter. Mattheson and Handel in 1704 and Bach in 1706
had thought of applying for the post, but were all frightened away by
this condition. Buxtehude’s successor was Johann Christian Schieferdecker,
who had been harpsichord player in the opera at Hamburg.</p></div>

paid 60 thalers = £9 a year for a “dwelling” for Bach during the
alterations to the Thomas School. Such a “dwelling” or “flat”
would now cost about £60 a year. An income of £100 in those
days would therefore represent the purchasing power of about £630
now: not a large sum on which to give nineteen children a first-class
education, and send two to the university.</p></div>

one. The writer was shown one of the above-mentioned Silbermann
pianos in the Palace of Sanssouci at Potsdam in 1884.</p></div>
